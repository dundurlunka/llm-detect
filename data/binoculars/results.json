Biden, Jr.\n\nChief Justice Roberts, Vice President Harris, Speaker Pelosi, Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Vice President Pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow Americans.\n\nThis is America's day.\n\nThis is democracy's day.\n\nA day of history and hope.\n\nOf renewal and resolve.\n\nThrough a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge.\n\nToday, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy.\n\nThe will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded.\n\nWe have learned again that democracy is precious.\n\nDemocracy is fragile.\n\nAnd at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.\n\nSo now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this Capitol's very foundation, we come together as one nation, under God, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries.\n\nWe look ahead in our uniquely American way \u2013 restless, bold, optimistic \u2013 and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be.\n\nI thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here.\n\nI thank them from the bottom of my heart.\n\nYou know the resilience of our Constitution and the strength of our nation.\n\nAs does President Carter, who I spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service.\n\nI have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took \u2014 an oath first sworn by George Washington.\n\nBut the American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us.\n\nOn \"We the People\" who seek a more perfect Union.\n\nThis is a great nation and we are a good people.\n\nOver the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. But we still have far to go.\n\nWe will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.\n\nMuch to repair.\n\nMuch to restore.\n\nMuch to heal.\n\nMuch to build.\n\nAnd much to gain.\n\nFew periods in our nation's history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we're in now.\n\nA once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country.\n\nIt's taken as many lives in one year as America lost in all of World War II.\n\nMillions of jobs have been lost.\n\nHundreds of thousands of businesses closed.\n\nA cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\n\nA cry for survival comes from the planet itself. A cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear.\n\nAnd now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\n\nTo overcome these challenges \u2013 to restore the soul and to secure the future of America \u2013 requires more than words.\n\nIt requires that most elusive of things in a democracy:\n\nUnity.\n\nUnity.\n\nIn another January in Washington, on New Year's Day 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nWhen he put pen to paper, the President said, \"If my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.\"\n\nMy whole soul is in it.\n\nToday, on this January day, my whole soul is in this:\n\nBringing America together.\n\nUniting our people.\n\nAnd uniting our nation.\n\nI ask every American to join me in this cause.\n\nUniting to fight the common foes we face:\n\nAnger, resentment, hatred.\n\nExtremism, lawlessness, violence.\n\nDisease, joblessness, hopelessness.\n\nWith unity we can do great things. Important things.\n\nWe can right wrongs.\n\nWe can put people to work in good jobs.\n\nWe can teach our children in safe schools.\n\nWe can overcome this deadly virus.",
            "1": "Fact check: Biden inauguration impacted by pandemic, security threats\n\nThe claim: Biden team added flags to the National Mall to make inauguration look less empty\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic and recent riot at the U.S. Capitol mean the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden will not follow all of the typical inauguration ceremony protocols.\n\nBiden made coronavirus precautions central to his campaign. And as his inaugural ceremony is taking place during the most deadly wave of the coronavirus, crowds were to be limited and mask wearing and social distancing enforced.\n\nOn top of coronavirus accommodations, the country is watching a transfer of power unlike any other. Now former-President Donald Trump did not attend \u2014 the first outgoing president in decades not to do so \u2014 and D.C. is virtually on lockdown following a pro-Trump riot earlier this month.\n\nMisinformation has been at the center of the 2020 election cycle, and is continuing into Inauguration Day.\n\nFollowing the addition of a public art exhibition of American flags on the National Mall, false claims have been circulating about the intention of the exhibit.\n\nOne Jan. 19 Facebook post claims, \"This is kind of hilarious in a really dark sort of tragic comedy way. Biden and his crew couldn't get real people to come to the inauguration so they planted flags to ensure it wouldn't look so empty.\"\n\nUSA TODAY was not able to reach the person who made the claim for comment.\n\nFact check: Photo captures House Speaker Nancy Pelosi thanking National Guard\n\nWhat are the flags for?\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, inaugural crowds will be limited and events that would have taken place in person, such as the traditional parade, will be televised virtually instead, USA TODAY reported.\n\nPerhaps the most notable change to the inaugural ceremony will be the absence of a crowd on the National Mall.\n\nInauguration: What will the crowd size at Joe Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20 look like?\n\nIn place of these crowds now stands a public art exhibition, made up of almost 200,000 American flags, which represent the Americans that will not be in attendance because of COVID-19.\n\nBiden ran an unconventional presidential campaign in order to keep coronavirus precautions at the forefront, making it unsurprising that his Inauguration Day will be upholding many of those same safety measures.\n\nFact check: What's true about the 2020 election, vote counting, Electoral College\n\nOur rating: Missing context",
            "2": "Highlights from Joe Biden's 2021 inauguration\n\nWashington CNN \u2014 President Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday looked a bit different from past ceremonies ushering in a new administration.\n\nThe day's historic events navigated heightened security measures in Washington, DC, Covid-19 precautions and the absence of the outgoing President, the first time that's happened in more than a century and a half.\n\nStill, the unprecedented day closed with fireworks and messages of unity and hope.\n\nHere are the highlights from the inauguration of America's 46th president:\n\nTrump leaves the White House\n\nThough former President Donald Trump did not attend Biden's swearing-in ceremony, he was publicly seen several times, including when he left the White House as president for the last time shortly after 8 a.m. ET.\n\nBefore boarding Marine One with the former first lady, Trump told reporters at the White House it was a \"great honor\" to serve as 45th President of the United States before saying goodbye.\n\nTrump speaks at Joint Base Andrews before heading to Florida\n\nTrump also held a final farewell ceremony, where both he and former first lady Melania Trump delivered remarks.\n\nThe former President thanked his family and chief of staff, and promised to \"always fight.\" He also wished the incoming Biden administration \"great luck,\" though he didn't mention his successor by name.\n\nMelania Trump, meanwhile, told attendees that \"being your first lady was my greatest honor.\" The two then boarded Air Force One for the last time just before 9 a.m., taking the presidential plane to their Florida home.\n\nBiden attends church\n\nJust after the Trumps boarded Air Force One, Biden and first lady Jill Biden headed over to Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle in DC, where they attended mass with their family, Vice President Kamala Harris and her family. They were joined by the congressional leaders of both parties.\n\nIncoming presidents typically attend services on the morning of their inauguration, often at St. John's Episcopal Church, a small church across Lafayette Square from the White House known as \"The Church of the Presidents.\"\n\nBiden arrives at Capitol\n\nBiden arrived at the US Capitol shortly after 11 a.m. and Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, accompanied him and Jill Biden up the steps of the iconic building.\n\nWhen Biden arrived at the inauguration stage, he greeted his predecessor and former boss, former President Barack Obama, on his way to his seat. He received a lengthy ovation from those gathered on the stage and sat down at 11:19 a.m.\n\nHarris and Obama first bump\n\nAs she walked to her seat on the inaugural stage, Harris shared double fist bumps with Obama.\n\nThe gesture, exchanged shortly before Harris was sworn in as vice president, carried symbolic weight as Obama and Harris made history as the first African Americans to serve as president and vice president, respectively.\n\nHarris similarly fist bumped Michelle Obama, who made history as the country's first African American first lady.\n\nHarris is sworn in as vice president\n\nHarris took the oath of office at 11:42 a.m. She used two Bibles during the oath, which was administered by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.\n\nHarris officially became the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president at noon.\n\nBiden is sworn in as the 46th president\n\nBiden completed his oath of office at 11:48 a.m., using a treasured family Bible that dates to the 19th century and was held by Jill Biden. The oath was administered by Chief Justice John Roberts.",
            "3": "Biden takes the helm, appeals for unity to take on crises\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States on Wednesday, declaring that \"democracy has prevailed\" and summoning American resilience and unity to confront the deeply divided nation's historic confluence of crises.\n\nDenouncing a national \"uncivil war,\" Biden took the oath at a U.S. Capitol that had been battered by an insurrectionist siege just two weeks earlier. Then, taking his place in the White House Oval Office, he plunged into a stack of executive actions that began to undo the heart of his polarizing predecessor 's agenda on matters from the deadly pandemic to climate change.\n\nAt the Capitol, with America's tradition of peaceful transfers of power never appearing more fragile, the ceremony unfolded within a circle of security forces evocative of a war zone and devoid of crowds because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nInstead, Biden gazed out on a cold Washington morning dotted with snow flurries to see over 200,000 American flags planted on the National Mall to symbolize those who could not attend in person.\n\n\"The will of the people has been heard, and the will of the people has been heeded. We've learned again that democracy is precious and democracy is fragile. At this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed,\" Biden declared in his speech. \"This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve.\"\n\nHistory was made at his side, as Kamala Harris became the first woman to be vice president. The former U.S. senator from California is also the first Black person and the first person of South Asian descent elected to the vice presidency and the highest-ranking woman ever to serve in the U.S. government.\n\nBiden never mentioned his predecessor, who defied tradition and left town ahead of the ceremony, but his speech was an implicit rebuke of Donald Trump. The new president denounced \"lies told for power and for profit\" and was blunt about the challenges ahead.\n\nCentral among them: the surging virus that has claimed more than 400,000 lives in the United States, as well as economic strains and a national reckoning over race.\n\n\"We have much to do in this winter of peril, and significant possibilities. Much to repair, much to restore, much to heal, much to build and much to gain,\" Biden said. \"Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged, or found a time more challenging or difficult than the time we're in now.\"\n\nBiden was eager to go big early, with an ambitious first 100 days including a push to speed up the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations to anxious Americans and pass a $1.9 trillion economic relief package. It included a blitz of executive orders on matters that don't require congressional approval \u2014 a mix of substantive and symbolic steps to unwind the Trump years. His actions included re-entry into the Paris Climate Accords and a mandate for wearing masks on federal property.\n\n\"There's no time to start like today,\" a masked Biden said. in the Oval Office.

But Trump's absence represents one final act of defiance of the norms and traditions of Washington that he has flouted for four years.\n\nHistorian Douglas Brinkley said that while attending the inauguration \"would be a wonderful olive branch to the country,\" he wasn't surprised by the decision.\n\n\"Donald Trump doesn't want to be in Washington as the second-fiddle loser standing on stage with Joe Biden,\" he said.\n\nWhile Trump stays away, former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will be there to stand witness to the rite of democracy. The only other living president, 96-year-old Jimmy Carter, who has spent the pandemic largely at home in Georgia, will not attend but has extended \"best wishes\" to Biden.\n\nTrump's tweet that he would boycott the inauguration came as he holed up in the White House with a dwindling coterie of aides and as momentum grew on Capitol Hill to subject him to impeachment for a second time.\n\n\"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,\" Trump said in a tweet.\n\nIt may have been his last. The company announced Friday evening that it had permanently suspended Trump from its platform, citing the \"risk of further incitement of violence.\" The sitting president said the company was trying to \"silence\" him and replied in an official statement that he was \"negotiating\" with other social media platforms while looking at \"the possibilities of building out our own platform.\"\n\nTrump's decision not to attend the inauguration was not a surprise: For more than two months, he has falsely claimed he won reelection and advanced baseless claims of widespread voter fraud, even though his own administration has said the election was fairly run.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, urged Trump to reconsider.\n\n\"He is, of course, not constitutionally required to attend and I can imagine losing an election is very hard, but I believe he should attend,\" Scott said in a statement. The senator called the rite \"an important tradition that demonstrates the peaceful transfer of power to our people and to the world.\"",

The legislature cancelled meetings next week, citing concerns about credible threats.\n\n\"We are prepared for the worst but we remain hopeful that those who choose to demonstrate at our Capitol do so peacefully,\" Michigan State Police Director Joe Gasper said during a news conference on Friday.\n\nIllinois Governor JB Pritzker said on Friday that while his state had not received any specific threats, he was beefing up security around the Capitol in Springfield, including adding about 250 state National Guard troops.\n\nThe alarm extended beyond legislatures, as well.",

True to form, Trump won't be attending his successor's inauguration\u2014not that anyone really wants to see him glowering behind Biden the whole ceremony anyway\u2014but there is significant concern that some of his ardent supporters might try.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the FBI on Monday tipped off law enforcement agencies to the threat of QAnon cultists descending on D.C. for the inauguration, possibly disguised as National Guard troops. \"QAnon members have discussed posing as National Guard soldiers, believing that it would be easy for them to infiltrate secure areas,\" the bureau said in an intelligence report, the Post reported. Devotees to the deranged conspiracy theory, which holds that Trump has been waging a secret war on a Democratic cabal of cannibal sex traffickers, were among the crowd of MAGA extremists who stormed the Capitol earlier this month as lawmakers formalized Biden's victory. While the FBI did not identify any specific plots against the inauguration on the scale of that siege, it is warning that Q adherents have been scheming up ways to disrupt Wednesday's ceremony, including by exploiting vulnerabilities in the capital city's security blanket and by blending in with the more than 20,000 troops that have been mobilized. The bureau is also warning of \"lone wolf\" threats to the ceremony.\n\n\"We're monitoring all incoming leads, whether they're calls for armed protest, potential threats that grow out of the January 6 breach of the Capitol, or other kinds of potential threats leading up to inaugural events and in various other targets,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said last week.\n\nThe threats of further violence has already made for a tense transition of power. But the possibility of insurrectionists posing as security forces could make the effort to protect the event even more complicated\u2014especially amid ongoing concerns about extremists within law enforcement and the military. The radicals who converged on Capitol Hill January 6 included several people with a history of service, including Ashli Babbitt, who was killed in the riot and has become something of a martyr to the pro-Trump right.

Yesterday, when she arrived at the Capitol for the inauguration dress rehearsal, she wore a simple and elegant white cape (via Givenchy by Matthew Williams) with a pretty plait crowning her head. Many fans were quick to note the Princess Leia vibes (see: Carrie Fisher in 1977's Star Wars: Episode IV).\n\nThis morning, as she stepped out onto the platform to sing the national anthem for the inauguration ceremony of 46th President Joe Biden, Gaga's look was decidedly more theatrical. The star opted for a custom Schiaparelli haute couture design\u2014a fitted navy cashmere jacket that gave way to a voluminous washed red silk faille skirt. Her hair was in the same braid as the day before, but with a red flower tucked into the back. The crowning glory of the outfit, though, was undoubtedly the giant gilded brooch in the shape of a dove, which, as we all know, is a symbol of peace.",

Armored vehicles and concrete barriers blocked empty streets. Miles of fencing cordoned off many of the nation's most familiar landmarks.\n\nJoe Biden was safely sworn in as president in a Washington on edge, two weeks after rioters loyal to former President Donald Trump besieged the Capitol.\n\nLaw enforcement officials contended not only with the potential for outside threats but also with rising concerns about an insider attack. Officials monitored members of far-right extremist and militia groups, increasingly concerned about the risk they could stream into Washington and spark violent confrontations, a law enforcement official said.\n\nThere were a few scattered arrests but no major protests or serious disruptions in the city during Biden's inauguration ceremony.\n\nAs Biden put it in his address: \"Here we stand just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen. It will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever.\"\n\nAfter the deadly attack that killed five on Jan. 6, the Secret Service stepped up security for the inauguration early, essentially locking down the nation's capital. More than 25,000 troops and police were called to duty. The National Mall was closed.

Pentagon officials would not give details on the statements. The FBI vetted all 25,000 members in an extraordinary security effort in part over the presence of some ex-military in the riot.\n\nTwo other U.S. officials told The Associated Press that all 12 were found to have ties with right-wing militia groups or to have posted extremist views online. The officials, a senior intelligence official and an Army official briefed on the matter, did not say which fringe groups the Guard members belonged to or what unit they served in. The officials told the AP they had all been removed because of \"security liabilities.\"\n\nThe officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nGen.

Even outgoing Vice President Mike Pence's tie, typically ruby red, appeared to be plucked from the burgundy region of Pantone's purple family.\n\nThe color purple is rich with symbolism. It's the color of royalty, and as Gwendolyn Dubois Shaw, senior historian of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, points out, \"Our democracy came out of a monarchy and colonial situation. We've never had our own royalty so we tend to project that desire.\"\n\nIt's the color of the Purple Heart, the badge of honor and bravery bestowed by the United States military on veterans wounded or killed in the line of duty. It's the title of Alice Walker's 1982 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about the plight of African American women in the South, a parallel with meaning not lost on the occasion of the swearing in of Harris, the first woman, the first Black and South Asian American to the office of Vice President.\n\nBut today the color purple was also as simple as 1, 2, 3.

In the video, Trump will say, \"This week, we inaugurate a new administration and pray for its success in keeping America safe and prosperous.\"\n\nTrump will also address the storming of the Capitol building by his supporters after he directed them to \"fight\" the election results showing he lost.\n\nHe will say that \"all Americans were horrified by the assault on our Capitol\" and that \"political violence is an attack on everything we cherish as Americans\" and \"can never be tolerated.\"\n\nTrump will also trumpet what he sees as his top achievements in office, including efforts to normalize relations in the Middle East.\n\nHe'll say: \"We did what we came here to do \u2014 and so much more.\"\n\n3:15 p.m.\n\nPentagon officials say 12 Army National Guard members have been removed from securing President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration after vetting by the FBI, including two who posted and texted extremist views about Wednesday's event.\n\nThere was no specific threat to Biden.\n\nTwo U.S. officials told The Associated Press that all 12 were found to have ties to right-wing militia groups or posted extremist views online. The officials, a senior intelligence official and an Army official briefed on the matter, did not say which fringe group the Guard members belonged to or what unit they served in. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.\n\nGen. Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard, confirmed Tuesday that the Guard members had been removed and sent home but said only two were for inappropriate comments or texts related to the inauguration. The other 10 were for other potential issues that may involve previous criminal activity, but not directly related to the inaugural event.\n\nThe officials told the AP they had all been removed because of \"security liabilities.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether they will face discipline when they return home.\n\n2:05 p.m.\n\nIn an emotional farewell, President-elect Joe Biden promised that even as he departs for Washington, D.C., to be sworn in, \"I'll always be a proud son of the state of Delaware.\"\n\nSpeaking Tuesday at an event at the National Guard headquarters in Delaware named for his late son, Beau, Biden's voice became thick with emotion as he told the crowd that \"when I die, I've got Delaware written on my heart.\" He said that \"it's deeply personal that our next journey to Washington starts here \u2014 the place that defines the very best of who we are as Americans.\"\n\nBiden gave farewell remarks to about 100 people, including numerous Delaware elected officials and members of Biden's family.\n\nHe's leaving Wilmington via plane Tuesday afternoon and will appear at a memorial for COVID-19 victims at the Lincoln Memorial in the evening. Biden will spend the night at Blair House, the president's official guesthouse, before moving into the White House after he is sworn in Wednesday.\n\n1:55 p.m.\n\nTen additional U.S. Army National Guard members are being removed from the security mission for the presidential inauguration of Joe Biden, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official and a U.S. Army official briefed on the matter. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity citing Pentagon regulations.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, the FBI sent a list of names to the National Guard Bureau who were identified as having ties to fringe right-wing groups or had posted extremist views. No active plots against Biden were found. The information was passed from the National Guard Bureau to the D.C. National Guard.",
            "16": "What You Need to Know About Joe Biden's Unprecedented Inauguration\n\nThis week's inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden will be like no other.\n\nWhile Biden is expected to follow the traditional swearing-in at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, in-person ceremonies have been scaled back and are heavily virtual due to novel coronavirus protections coupled with massive post-insurrection security measures to ward against possible violence in Washington, D.C.\n\nCrowds of tourists have been asked to stay away and in their stead are upwards of 25,000 National Guard soldiers protecting the heart of the nation's capital. At night, the glitz and glamour of black-tie inaugural balls will be replaced by a star-studded virtual concert hosted by Tom Hanks streamed live and broadcast on the major networks.\n\nThere will be a mix of other events this week, including a memorial on Tuesday for the victims of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's what else you need to know about the inauguration of the 46th president of the United States.\n\nWhat events are leading up to Wednesday?\n\nSeveral days of virtual programming kicked off Sunday night with a concert, followed by events Monday on Martin Luther King Day devoted to service and promoted by President-elect Biden's inaugural committee.\n\nBiden spent some of the day volunteering at a Philadelphia hunger relief organization while Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, volunteered in D.C.\n\nOrganizers encouraged others to volunteer for Monday and beyond at bideninaugural.org\/day-of-service.\n\nOn Tuesday night, a lighting ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool to honor people killed by COVID-19 will be held \"to memorialize American lives lost,\" the Presidential Inaugural Committee said.\n\nThe committee is inviting communities around the country to join the Washington ceremony by lighting up buildings and ringing church bells at 5:30 p.m. local time in \"a national moment of unity and remembrance.\"\n\nHow and when will Joe Biden arrive?\n\nPlans for Biden to take an Amtrak from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to D.C. were scrapped earlier this week in part due to heightened security concerns, according to CNN, which first reported the news. (A Biden inaugural spokesman said in response only that his travel plans had never been made public.)\n\nIt is not clear how he will now arrive in D.C., reports CBS News.\n\nBiden has, however, accepted an invitation to stay at the historic Blair House, across the street from the White House, the night before the inauguration. But it's unclear whether that's where he will be sleeping, according to The Washington Post.\n\nWhat are some of the other changes due to security?\n\nAmid concerns about another incident, in the wake of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Biden's inauguration rehearsal, originally set for Sunday, was postponed to Monday, Politico reported Thursday night.\n\nThe move came after Biden and his team received a briefing last Wednesday about threats from the FBI, the Secret Service and national security officials, according to Politico.\n\nOn Thursday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the bureau was tracking an \"extensive amount of concerning online chatter,\" including calls for armed protests leading up to the inauguration.\n\n\"When we talk about potential threats, we have to say about that we are seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter about a number of events surrounding the inauguration,\" Wray said in his first briefing since the rioting at the Capitol, where five people died.\n\nThe National Mall will be closed and National Guard troops will be in place to keep Biden safe and thwart a possible repeat of the violence.\n\nHow many will be at the inauguration?\n\nA familiar theme of inaugurations past \u2014 crowd size \u2014 will be much downplayed this year, given the unusual circumstances.",
            "17": "Yes, Biden's inauguration was legitimate. No, this isn't a movie\n\nThe inauguration was witnessed by several people and broadcast live by numerous outlets. Biden has been seen several times in the White House.\n\nClaims that the inauguration was fake or that Joe Biden is not the real president are not accurate. There's no evidence.\n\nA new conspiracy theory has blossomed among some people who believed that former President Donald Trump had an elaborate scheme to remain in office: that Biden's inauguration was fake, and he isn't the real president.\n\nThe theory started to gain traction online when the Jan. 20 \"storm\" disrupting Biden's inauguration didn't happen. It points to a myriad of ill-perceived discrepancies for what a real inauguration and presidency should look like.\n\nThese claims fall short. Biden is the real president and his inauguration was legit. The day's events were broadcast and live-streamed by several outlets including ABC, CNN, C-SPAN, Fox News, NBC and PBS.\n\nThe event was much smaller this year due to COVID-19 restrictions. But we know it happened because it was witnessed and documented by elected officials, former presidents, military members, reporters, photographers and performers.\n\nSocial media posts and videos spreading the theory were flagged as part of Facebook's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)\n\nWe debunked a variety of claims that argue the inauguration didn't happen and that Biden isn't the legitimate president.\n\n\"The White House's inauguration video was unlisted\"\n\nSome people on Facebook claimed that the White House's official inauguration video was unlisted on YouTube because it had more dislikes than likes.\n\nIndeed, the 34-minute video has many more dislikes than likes \u2014 currently 76,000 to 14,000 \u2014 but it is still up on the White House YouTube channel. Web archives show no record that the video was ever taken down.\n\n\"Biden's executive orders aren't available online\"\n\nAccording to one viral video, Trump's executive orders were available on the Office of the Federal Register website \"immediately,\" while there are still no sign of Biden's.\n\nThat's false. Biden's executive orders may not have been uploaded at the time the video was made, but the documents are published on the site now. The online register shows that it also took a few days for Trump's orders to be published after they were signed.\n\n\"Biden's granddaughters disappeared and reappeared in between frames of inauguration coverage\"\n\nSome claim that the inauguration was staged because Biden's granddaughters, who were standing behind him when he took the oath of office, suddenly disappeared in certain shots.\n\nThey didn't. Biden's granddaughters may not have been visible at certain points due to different camera angles, but they were present throughout the oath and did not move. They can also be seen standing behind Biden in photographs taken by Reuters and the Associated Press.\n\n\"Biden took a private plane to D.C.\"\n\nBiden's form of travel has nothing to do with the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nBiden originally planned to travel to Washington by train from Delaware, but that plan changed when it was deemed too great a security risk. So he took a private jet, which was also a break from tradition.\n\nUsually the outgoing administration provides a government plane to bring the president-elect to Washington for the inauguration. Trump, who refused to acknowledge Biden's victory until early January, opted to not attend the inauguration, becoming the first outgoing president in more than a century to skip the event.\n\nWe previously reached out to the White House, but couldn't confirm whether the Trump administration offered to provide transportation to the Bidens. CNN reported that \"a source familiar with the matter\" said the government didn't offer the Bidens a plane, but did not provide further details.\n\n\"Biden's Oval Office is a movie set\"\n\nSome social media users have shared photos of Biden in the Oval Office and say they provide proof that it's not the real presidential office but a movie set owned by Castle Rock Entertainment.\n\nFilm sets of the famous room exist, but there is no credible evidence that supports this. Biden made a public entrance into the White House on Jan. 20 and was photographed in the Oval Office shortly after. He has been seen in the White House several times in the days that have followed.\n\nSome point to a vehicle visible outside the window behind the Resolute Desk as Biden sits there, saying there is no parking lot in that location. But the Oval Office overlooks the South Lawn and has a private road and circular driveway, both places where the car could have been parked.\n\nOur ruling\n\nA conspiracy theory circulating on social media says that Biden's inauguration was fake and that he isn't the real president.\n\nThe evidence is paltry. Biden was legally inaugurated as the 46th U.S. president on Jan. 20.",

Because of coronavirus, social visits only resumed in October, but many facilities have canceled them again as infections spiked.\n\nOne reason for the new nationwide lockdown is that the bureau is moving some of its Special Operations Response Teams from prison facilities to Washington, D.C., to bolster security after President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. Authorities are concerned there could be more violence, not only in the nation's capital, but also at state capitals, before Trump leaves office Jan. 20.\n\nA Bureau of Prisons spokesman said the agency was coordinating with officials at the Justice Department to be ready to deploy as needed. Earlier this month, about 100 officers were sent to the Justice Department's headquarters to supplement security staff and were deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service and given special legal powers to \"enforce federal criminal statutes and protect federal property and personnel,\" said the spokesman, Justin Long.\n\nThe specialized units typically respond to disturbances and other emergencies at prisons, such as riots, assaults, escapes and escape attempts, and hostage situations.

Biden asked for his contact information and offered to share the strategies he used to overcome his stutter.\n\n\"Don't let it define you,\" Biden told Brayden. \"You are smart as hell.\"\n\nBiden has spoken publicly of being teased throughout his childhood about his stutter.

            "29": "The New Radicals Reunited For Joe Biden's Inauguration. Maybe America Is Gonna Pull Through.\n\n\"Don't give up,\" New Radicals begged us in their classic 1998 single \"You Get What You Give.\" And if they didn't take their own advice, if they never followed up on that pop song's promise, if they left our nation wanting a whole lot more, today is a day to celebrate. The band has reunited after 22 years to perform the song as part of the Biden-Harris virtual inaugural parade. It is a benediction for a next-level '90s pop song, an exclamation point at the end of a joyful day, a \"Don't Stop\" moment for a new generation.\n\nIt is, to borrow a phrase from our new President, a big fucking deal. Here's why.\n\nIf you're new to the Radicals, the band was essentially a duo: singer Gregg Alexander and percussionist Danielle Brisebois. Michigan-born Alexander had bounced around the music business as a little-known teenage pop artist in the late 1980s, while Brisebois achieved success as a child actor, starring in the later seasons of All In The Family and on Broadway as the original Molly in Annie. After Brisebois was recruited to sing backing vocals on Alexander's second solo album Intoxifornication, they went on to co-write tracks for her first, Arrive All Over You. If it had stopped with simply those two album titles, it would have been enough. But it didn't; there was a spark, they formed a band, and they got signed by MCA Records, because MCA Records knew what was up.\n\nMaybe You've Been Brainwashed Too was released in late 1998 to instant critical acclaim, and for good reason. It is what we would now call \"a mood,\" and a particularly good one. It is an early summer day all year long, an antidepressant with zero side effects. Alexander wrote and produced every track, finally nailing his unique sound, which has endured long after he disappeared. (More on that later.) Though the album is best known for its one hit single, it is banger city from start to finish.\n\nAnd oh that one hit single. \"You Get What You Give\" is the greatest pop-rock song of the last 25 years, and if you disagree, I need you to take a quiet moment and reflect on why you've chosen to reject pleasure. Though the song-ending call-outs of Courtney Love and Marilyn Manson still get most of the attention, the song itself is about the resilience of the human spirit. Its chugging piano is the sound of a soul struggling to see the bright side. The song gave us the word \"frenemies,\" and the video sent me on a still-fruitless search for that windbreaker. It is the perfect jam for a tense time in history, a song whose optimism is hard-won.\n\nFlatiron Books Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose Flatiron Books Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose Now 72% Off $8 at Amazon\n\nIt is for that reason that the song has significance to the Biden family. In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, President Biden reveals that his son Beau used \"You Get What You Give\" as a psych-up song for his chemotherapy treatments, and when it became clear that his brain cancer was inoperable, the family continued to play it for him to keep his spirits up. In honor of Beau, First Gentleman Doug Emhoff uses it as his walk-on music. It's in the pantheon.\n\nNew Radicals dissolved before their second single \"Someday We'll Know\" was released, as Alexander found the spotlight too stressful. But even if you didn't know it, you still had their music in you. Brisebois co-wrote Natasha Bedingfield's \"Unwritten,\" while Alexander lent his signature sound to Santana & Michelle Branch's \"The Game Of Love,\" the Oscar-nominated \"Lost Stars\" from Begin Again, and what pop historians unanimously recognize as our greatest blowjob anthem, \"I'm Gonna Blow Your Mind\" by Carly Hennessy, who would later go on to American Idol fame as Carly Smithson.

For one to say something after last week's event would be noteworthy and rare enough. For all eight Joint Chiefs to speak out together \u2014 in a \"message to the Joint Force,\" no less \u2014 shows just how perilous they deem this moment to be.\n\n\"The violent riot in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021 was a direct assault on the U.S. Congress the Capitol building, and our Constitutional process,\" the letter signed by all the Joint Chiefs reads. \"We witnessed actions inside the Capitol building that were inconsistent with the rule of law. The rights of freedom of speech and assembly do not give anyone the right to resort to violence, sedition and insurrection.\"\n\nWhile that may be a general statement about the insurrection meant more for the public, the next section was clearly meant for the troops they help lead.\n\n\"As Service Members, we must embody the values and ideals of the Nation. We support and defend the Constitution,\" they wrote. \"Any act to disrupt the Constitutional process is not only against our traditions, values, and oath; it is against the law.\"\n\n\"President-elect Joe Biden,\" they concluded, \"will be inaugurated and will become our 46th Commander in Chief.\"\n\nThere are likely two main reasons why Joint Chiefs Chair Army Gen. Mark Milley and the seven others felt the need to pen the letter.\n\nFirst, veterans and possibly even some active-duty troops were allegedly involved in the attack on the Capitol last week. That means the military community certainly contains people who wrongly believe the presidential election was stolen, subscribe to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or have far-right tendencies.\n\nRegardless of their passions or views, military leaders aim to keep the armed services as apolitical as possible. Otherwise, some might associate the military with one party or another, and that isn't healthy for a democracy.\n\nSecond, the Joint Chiefs tend to speak out when something really egregious has happened, and there's no question the Capitol insurrection fits the bill. \"[T]hey have developed a finely tuned 'political' (small p) radar on when to weigh in,\" CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nFor example, after President Donald Trump said some attendees at the 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville were \"very fine people,\" all the Joint Chiefs spoke out against racism and bigotry. \"The Army doesn't tolerate racism, extremism, or hatred in our ranks. It's against our Values and everything we've stood for since 1775,\" Milley, who was chief of staff of the Army then, said at the time.\n\nBased on this letter, it looks as though America's top military officials won't tolerate another thing: the attempted overthrow of American democracy by force.",

Thank a Chicago-founded company that 'wanted it big.'\n\nThe smash ending to a smash day in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday was Katy Perry singing \"Firework\" as, appropriately enough, fireworks went off around the Washington Monument behind her. Many, many fireworks.\n\nThat display, a stunning four minutes or so, was created by Strictly FX, a company founded in Chicago in 1996 that does most of its pyrotechnics business with touring rock shows and events like the Super Bowl. And it served as the finale to the \"Celebrating America\" prime-time television special devoted to President Joseph Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Inauguration Day.\n\nThe internet exploded afterward, mostly congratulating Perry for her performance. The fireworks were credited mostly as backdrop. That's fine with Adam Biscow and FX; Biscow is the designer that created the show, the guy who put the white burst directly behind Perry's outstretched hand just as she hit her final chorus and elicited a breathless \"Oh yeah!\" from host Tom Hanks as he signed off the show.\n\nSpeaking with the Tribune from the Washington Mall on Thursday, he said shows like Wednesday's are a team effort. Strictly FX, which moved its headquarters to Nashville in 2018 but maintains an office in Mount Prospect as well as California, created the show, with the shells fired by Garden State Fireworks of New Jersey, which holds the contract to do fireworks in the city and is a frequent collaborator.\n\n\"We don't do shows like this for the credit,\" Biscow said. \"We do it for the love of what we do, it's little piece of history we got to take part in.\"\n\nStrictly FX also did the show for Biden's victory speech in Wilmington, Delaware, in November that got attention for its use of drones, and Biscow said the president-elect came in and thanked the crew personally afterward.\n\nIn this image from video, singer Katy Perry performs during the \"Celebrating America\" event on Wednesday, following the inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States.

It was all over the board,\" McCarthy explained when asked about preparations for crowd control. \"It was very hard to make that determination of what you're dealing with,\" he told reporters on a call, adding that the Defense department relied on law enforcement threat assessments. Through the weekend, 6,200 National Guard personnel will deploy to the nation's capital and remain in the region for a minimum of 30 days. The month-long mobilization ensures that the National Guard members will be on hand for the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden. The troops, who are unarmed, will monitor traffic control points and provide support to law enforcement as authorities work to secure the perimeter surrounding the Capitol Building one day after a mob supporting President Donald Trump stormed it.\n\nThe mobilization comes as the nation continues to process Wednesday's startling riot in which at least four people died. All four living former presidents have condemned the day's events, in which a violent mob disrupted lawmakers from the typically perfunctory process of formally confirming Biden's victory. The D.C. National Guard was mobilized during the riots and about 1,100 troops were sent to assist local police in tamping down the insurrection, the Pentagon said. The deployment came after Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi requested the force, two sources told NBC News. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo all announced plans to send National Guard troops to D.C. as well. Trump, who spoke at a rally to protest the results of the election shortly before his supporters infiltrated Congress, still has not condemned the rioting or conceded defeat.

            "38": "Joe Biden is the first US president to call out white supremacy in inaugural address\n\nRace played an important role in US president Joe Biden's inaugural speech on Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking of the issues that the country now faces, Biden alluded to this summer's Black Lives Matter protests, citing \"a cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making,\" and adding, \"The dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\" He decried \"the sting of systemic racism\" and the ways that racism has shaped the US, saying, \"Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we're all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.\" He referenced Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, issued in 1863. And in a particularly noteworthy moment, Biden cited a \"rise of political extremism, white supremacy, [and] domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat.\"\n\nBiden is not the first US president to discuss racism in his inaugural address. In Barack Obama's first speech as president, he observed that \"a man whose father less than 60 years ago might not have been served at a local restaurant can now stand before you to take a most sacred oath.\" President George W. Bush in 2005 and president Bill Clinton in 1997 both acknowledged the persistence of racism in the US.\n\nBut Biden is the first to specifically acknowledge the existence of white supremacy. That's an important sign of the way that the popular understanding of racism in the US has evolved in recent years, and of how Biden may approach racial inequality in office.\n\nAs the New York Times explained last fall, for the past few decades, the American mainstream media was more likely to reserve the phrase \"white supremacy\" to describe Nazis or the Ku Klux Klan\u2014hate groups that claimed their own bigotry and had an explicit agenda to kill and\/or oppress people of color and Jewish people.\n\nBut over the past 10 years, influential people like writer Ta-Nehisi Coates and activist-athlete Colin Kaepernick have helped to not only popularize the term, but to broaden its application to refer not only to those who explicitly embrace white supremacy. In the current parlance\u2014and particularly in the wake of the widespread discussions about racism that began last summer\u2014white supremacy is understood as a force enacted through systems and institutions that benefits white people while oppressing non-white people, evident in everything from the US legal system to the way corporations hire.\n\nWhite supremacy is particularly useful as a term that encapsulates the ways racism can be reinforced independently of individual prejudice. \"People have this misconception that [white supremacy] has something to do with hate or racial animus, and it doesn't,\" journalist Michael Harriott explained in an interview last summer. The fact that majority-white schools have more funding than majority-Black schools, or that Black people are disproportionately more likely to be shot and killed by police, are illustrations of white supremacy in action.",

In this case, the business owner is Lorie Smith, a website designer in Colorado who wants to opt out of providing her graphic design services for same-sex weddings despite the civil rights law in her state.\n\nJennifer Pizer, acting chief legal officer of Lambda Legal, said in an interview with the Blade, \"it's not too much to say an immeasurably huge amount is at stake\" for LGBTQ people depending on the outcome of the case.\n\n\"This contrived idea that making custom goods, or offering a custom service, somehow tacitly conveys an endorsement of the person \u2014 if that were to be accepted, that would be a profound change in the law,\" Pizer said. \"And the stakes are very high because there are no practical, obvious, principled ways to limit that kind of an exception, and if the law isn't clear in this regard, then the people who are at risk of experiencing discrimination have no security, no effective protection by having a non-discrimination laws, because at any moment, as one makes their way through the commercial marketplace, you don't know whether a particular business person is going to refuse to serve you.\"\n\nThe upcoming arguments and decision in the 303 Creative case mark a return to LGBTQ rights for the Supreme Court, which had no lawsuit to directly address the issue in its previous term, although many argued the Dobbs decision put LGBTQ rights in peril and threatened access to abortion for LGBTQ people.\n\nAnd yet, the 303 Creative case is similar to other cases the Supreme Court has previously heard on the providers of services seeking the right to deny services based on First Amendment grounds, such as Masterpiece Cakeshop and Fulton v. City of Philadelphia. In both of those cases, however, the court issued narrow rulings on the facts of litigation, declining to issue sweeping rulings either upholding non-discrimination principles or First Amendment exemptions.\n\nPizer, who signed one of the friend-of-the-court briefs in opposition to 303 Creative, said the case is \"similar in the goals\" of the Masterpiece Cakeshop litigation on the basis they both seek exemptions to the same non-discrimination law that governs their business, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, or CADA, and seek \"to further the social and political argument that they should be free to refuse same-sex couples or LGBTQ people in particular.\"\n\n\"So there's the legal goal, and it connects to the social and political goals and in that sense, it's the same as Masterpiece,\" Pizer said. \"And so there are multiple problems with it again, as a legal matter, but also as a social matter, because as with the religion argument, it flows from the idea that having something to do with us is endorsing us.\"\n\nOne difference: the Masterpiece Cakeshop litigation stemmed from an act of refusal of service after owner, Jack Phillips, declined to make a custom-made wedding cake for a same-sex couple for their upcoming wedding. No act of discrimination in the past, however, is present in the 303 Creative case. The owner seeks to put on her website a disclaimer she won't provide services for same-sex weddings, signaling an intent to discriminate against same-sex couples rather than having done so.",

Those sources could not confirm when the first F-35 is due to be delivered to Abu Dhabi, but stated that an initial proposal stipulated 2027 as one possible date.\n\nThe UAE deal was previously estimated at a $23.37 billion value, including 50 F-35A fighters worth $10.4 billion, 18 MQ-9B drones worth $2.97 billion, and $10 billion worth of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions.\n\nThose dollar totals are expected to shift around during further negotiations with F-35 prime contractor Lockheed Martin and MQ-9 maker General Atomics.\n\nIt's unclear whether the incoming administration will seek to undo the deal. Biden's pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, told reporters in late October that the sale is \"something we would look at very, very carefully,\" due to U.S. obligations to preserve Israel's qualitative military edge.",

Justices Clarence Thomas, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr., the court's three oldest, were the no-shows. \"Several of the justices elected not to attend the inauguration ceremony in light of the public health risks posed by the COVID pandemic,\" Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg said in a statement.\n\nThe justices have not conducted business in person since March \u2014 holding private conferences and oral arguments via teleconference \u2014 although they gathered at a memorial service for Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September.\n\nChief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., for the fourth time, administered the oath of office to the president-elect. But he has yet to see a supporter on the other side of the Bible.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, whom Roberts swore in twice, voted against his confirmation to the Supreme Court in 2005. So did Biden. And President Donald Trump, to whom Roberts administered the oath in 2017, made clear during the campaign that he considered Roberts a \"disaster.\"\n\nThe relationship during that presidency was a rocky one, and the chief justice had the chore of presiding over Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate.\n\nBut the theme of Biden's inaugural address was putting differences aside, and the new president may have warmer thoughts these days for Roberts, who turns 66 next week. Roberts was the deciding vote to save Obamacare, the chief domestic accomplishment of the Obama-Biden administration.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina on the Supreme Court, swore in Vice President Harris, the first woman to hold the job. Sotomayor did the same for then-Vice President Biden in 2013.\n\nAlso in attendance was Justice Elena Kagan, nominated by Obama, and all three of Trump's selections for the court: Justices Neil M. Gorsuch, Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThat presented more opportunities for awkwardness: They were seated behind Harris, who vigorously opposed all three. In particular, she conducted a heated grilling of Kavanaugh that thrilled liberals and deeply angered conservatives.\n\nAs a team, former senators Biden and Harris voted against six of the nine justices on the current court.\n\nThat might explain some of the no-shows.\n\nThomas, 72, and Alito, 70, are a different story.\n\nBiden attempted to filibuster Alito's nomination and said President George W. Bush's choice was too conservative to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who at the time was the Supreme Court's pivotal justice.\n\nBiden has even more history with Thomas, who was confirmed when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Thomas's nomination was disrupted by allegations of sexual harassment leveled by Anita Hill, who previously had worked in government jobs with Thomas.",

The issue took on new urgency after a Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by supporters of then-President Donald Trump who were trying to overturn Biden's election victory.\n\nThe new strategy stopped short of calling for new laws to fight domestic threats, and officials on Tuesday did not offer many details on specific new resources.\n\n\"We concluded that we didn't have the evidentiary basis, yet, to decide whether we wanted to proceed in that direction or whether we have sufficient authority as it currently exists at the federal level,\" said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in advance of the announcement.\n\nIn a speech on Tuesday, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in the \"coming days and months\" he would convene an interagency task force dedicated to combating domestic terrorism. Garland said he has already \"begun to reinvigorate\" that task force.\n\nGarland said the Jan. 6 attack by Trump supporters had shown white supremacists and militia groups to be the country's greatest domestic security threat.\n\n\"In the FBI's view, the top domestic violent extremist threat comes from racially or ethnically motivated violent extremists, specifically those who advocated for the superiority of the white race,\" Garland said.\n\nIn his budget proposal released last month, Biden, who succeeded Trump on Jan. 20, sought $100 million in additional funding to train and hire analysts and prosecutors to disrupt and deter terrorist activity.\n\n\"The threat is elevated,\" the administration official said. \"Tackling it means ensuring that we do have the resources and personnel to address that elevated threat.\"\n\nThe administration is also toughening the federal government's screening methods to better identify employees who may pose insider threats. They are looking to share those techniques with private companies.\n\nThat effort includes an ongoing review by the Department of Defense over how and when to remove military members who are found to be engaged in known domestic terrorist groups.\n\nThe Defense Department review is looking at, among other things, how to define extremists, the senior administration official said.",

The proceedings moved at lightning speed, with lawmakers voting just one week after violent pro-Trump loyalists stormed the U.S. Capitol, egged on by the president's calls for them to \"fight like hell\" against the election results.\n\nTen Republicans fled Trump, joining Democrats who said he needed to be held accountable and warned ominously of a \"clear and present danger\" if Congress should leave him unchecked before Democrat Joe Biden's inauguration Jan. 20.\n\nTrump is the only U.S. president to be twice impeached. It was the most bipartisan presidential impeachment in modern times, more so than against Bill Clinton in 1998.\n\nThe Capitol insurrection stunned and angered lawmakers, who were sent scrambling for safety as the mob descended, and it revealed the fragility of the nation's history of peaceful transfers of power. The riot also forced a reckoning among some Republicans, who have stood by Trump throughout his presidency and largely allowed him to spread false attacks against the integrity of the 2020 election.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi invoked Abraham Lincoln and the Bible, imploring lawmakers to uphold their oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign \"and domestic.\"\n\nShe said of Trump: \"He must go, he is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\"\n\nHoled up at the White House, watching the proceedings on TV, Trump later released a video statement in which he made no mention at all of the impeachment but appealed to his supporters to refrain from any further violence or disruption of Biden's inauguration.\n\n\"Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week,\" he said, his first condemnation of the attack. He appealed for unity \"to move forward\" and said, \"Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. ... No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement.\"\n\nTrump was first impeached by the House in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, but the Senate voted in 2020 acquit. He is the first president to be impeached twice. None has been convicted by the Senate, but Republicans said Wednesday that could change in the rapidly shifting political environment as officeholders, donors, big business and others peel away from the defeated president.\n\nBiden said in a statement after the vote that it was his hope the Senate leadership \"will find a way to deal with their Constitutional responsibilities on impeachment while also working on the other urgent business of this nation.\"\n\nThe soonest Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell would start an impeachment trial is next Tuesday, the day before Trump is already set to leave the White House, McConnell's office said.

Gen. William Walker, commanding general of the District of Columbia National Guard, told senators that the then-chief of the Capitol Police requested military support in a \"voice cracking with emotion\" in a 1:49 p.m. call as rioters began pushing toward the Capitol. Walker said he immediately relayed the request to the Army but did not learn until after 5 p.m. that the Defense Department had approved it. Guard troops who had been waiting on buses were then rushed to the Capitol, arriving in 18 minutes, Walker said.\n\nThe hourslong delay cost the National Guard precious minutes in the early hours of the Jan. 6 rioting, with Walker saying he could have gotten personnel into the building within 20 minutes of getting approval. As it stood, the support did not happen until the evening. The delay also stood in contrast to the swift authorization for National Guard deployment that Walker said was granted in response to the civil unrest that roiled Washington last June as an outgrowth of racial justice protests.\n\nA senior Pentagon official who testified, Robert Salesses, said then-acting Defense Secretary Chris Miller wanted to take time to understand precisely how National Guard troops would be used at the Capitol and what assignments they would be given. Mindful of criticism that the response to the demonstrations last spring was heavy-handed, military officials were also concerned about the optics of a substantial National Guard presence at the Capitol, and thought such visuals could inflame the rioters, Walker said.\n\n\"The Army senior leadership\" expressed \"that it would not be their best military advice to have uniformed Guardsmen on the Capitol,\" Walker said.\n\nThe Senate hearing was the latest in a series dedicated to the government's preparations and response as a mob of then-President Donald Trump's supporters laid siege to the Capitol. Taken together, the hearings have spelled out the challenge law enforcement officials face in sorting through an ocean of unverified tips but also highlighted how police inadequately prepared for the Trump loyalists; that FBI warnings about the threat of violence did not reach top police officials; and that requests for aid were not promptly answered.\n\n\"Anytime there's an attack, we in the FBI want to bat 1,000, and we want to not ever have this happen again,\" said Jill Sanborn, the bureau's top counterterrorism official and one of the witnesses. \"So we're asking ourselves exactly the questions that you're asking: Is there a place that we could have collected more (intelligence)? Is there something we could have done?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Capitol Police disclosed the existence of intelligence of a \"possible plot\" by a militia group to breach the Capitol on Thursday.

The incident followed a weeks-long misinformation campaign by Trump and his supporters, claiming without evidence that the November 2020 election had been stolen.\n\nFive people died during or shortly after the insurrection, while dozens of police were wounded.\n\nTuesday's hearing also takes place amid an ongoing political battle over how deeply Congress \u2013 which has already conducted several hearings and reports on January 6 \u2013 should further investigate the incident, with Republican brass largely boycotting the continued probe, despite previously voicing support for a thorough investigation.\n\n\"We're going to tell this story from the beginning,\" said Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin, a Democrat who sits on the panel. \"The moral centre of gravity is these officers who put their lives on the line for us.\"\n\nThe latest probe, initially envisioned as a bipartisan, independent 9\/11-style commission, is moving forward in the Democrat-majority House of Representatives, but was blocked by Republicans in the Senate in May.\n\nPolitical battle\n\nLast week, House Republican leadership pulled its five appointments to the panel after Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi rejected two of the picks \u2013 Representatives Jim Banks and Jim Jordan \u2013 who were vocal proponents of the Trump camp's misinformation.\n\nWith Republicans leaders refusing to participate, Pelosi has since appointed two vocal Trump critics \u2013 Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger \u2013 to the panel.\n\nRepublicans, who have sought to turn attention away from the January 6 riot as 2022 midterm elections approach, have tried to discredit the most recent investigation.",
            "49": "Capitol Riot Tactics Strongly Resemble Those Used in 2020 Riots\n\nWatching rioters breach the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as members of Congress were certifying the presidential election inside was alarming and raised many questions regarding the security of the Capitol\u2014one of the most important federal buildings in our nation.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police and city officials had known that the \"Stop the Steal\" rally would be taking place Jan. 6 for weeks. Why was it so easy for rioters to get past security? Why didn't Capitol Police have more officers in the building and at the entrances? What must terrorists think of our seat of government's security?\n\nThe presidential inauguration is only days away. There must be better security for that event than what we saw Wednesday.\n\nPolitical violence is inexcusable, no matter who is committing it, and public safety is crucial to protect individual freedoms and equal protection under the law.\n\nWhile Black Lives Matter protests have sometimes turned violent, and Antifa has a long history of association with violence, pro-Trump demonstrations have mostly been peaceful in the past. This may have put Capitol Police in an erroneously relaxed posture.\n\nBut public safety officials must always be prepared for the possibility that instigators and political opportunists might goad a crowd to violence.\n\nWashington has dozens of law enforcement agencies, each with different jurisdictions. But unlike the other agencies that report to the city or the federal executive branch, Capitol Police are part of the legislative branch. They report to congressional leaders.\n\nThe day of the riot, Capitol Police was worked with the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department, the U.S. Secret Service (a division of the Department of Homeland Security), and U.S. Park Police (a division of the Interior Department), as it commonly does, to make our public spaces secure, accessible, and protect the process of democracy.\n\nCapitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who resigned Thursday effective Jan. 16, stated that the Capitol attack was unlike anything he had ever experienced in his 30 years of law enforcement in Washington. Rioters attacked Capitol Police officers and other uniformed law enforcement officers with metal pipes, chemical irritants, and other weapons.\n\n\"They were determined to enter into the Capitol Building by causing great damage,\" Sund said.\n\nMore than 50 Capitol Police and Metropolitan Police Department officers sustained injuries during the attack on the Capitol.\n\nSeveral Capitol Police officers were hospitalized with serious injuries, and one officer died of his injuries, in addition to the Trump supporter who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer.\n\nLaw enforcement in Washington often has to maintain law and order while allowing Americans to practice their First Amendment rights. In many scenarios, this is a challenging balance to strike.\n\nSund's description of the clashes with Capitol Police sounds familiar because it is. The tactics used in the riot last week resemble those used in riots that occurred in multiple cities throughout 2020. Law enforcement officers and buildings around the U.S. have been attacked with pipes, rocket-grade fireworks, and other dangerous weapons since May by Antifa and Black Lives Matter criminals.\n\nThe difference is the 2020 riots occurred in the dark of night and most of the mainstream media showed little of the rioters' violence, downplaying the attacks as \"peaceful protests.\"\n\nSlowly, information is coming forward that bad actors at prior riots were involved at the Capitol riot as well. Some rioters wore the typical black bloc garb and helmets, others donned Trump paraphernalia to blend in. At a minimum, Wednesday's assault on the Capitol was fully informed by the lessons of previous actions.\n\nThe rioters had watched the tactics and techniques of the Antifa criminals (which included violence, weapons, and destruction) and the nearly non-existent legal repercussions meted out by liberal city and state governments (the vast majority of criminals who were arrested were released without charges), as well as the validation the earlier rioters received (such as having streets named for them).\n\nIt is critical that Capitol Police and other law enforcement prepare for Inauguration Day and other mass demonstrations where opinions are strongly divided, causing emotions to run high, by using the successful enforcement tactics during the 2020 riots.\n\nFortunately, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and Capitol Police have started doing so.\n\nDuring the Capitol riot, additional National Guard units were called in; Bowser set a curfew and extended her emergency order for 15 days, which will cover the inauguration.\n\nAt the request of Capitol Police, Homeland Security installed additional protective fencing Thursday around the perimeter of the Capitol grounds, a tactic the department used to protect U.S. courthouses and other federal property in Portland, Oregon, and other cities during the 2020 riots.\n\nMeanwhile, law enforcement agencies have made dozens of arrests and requested information on numerous individuals photographed inside the Capitol.",

Some of Trump's supporters were armed and ready for war: an Alabama man allegedly parked a pickup truck with 11 homemade bombs, an assault rifle and a handgun two blocks from the Capitol hours before authorities discovered it, according to federal prosecutors. Another man allegedly showed up with an assault rifle and hundreds of rounds of ammunition, telling acquaintances he wanted to shoot or run over House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Pipe bombs were found near the headquarters of the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committee as authorities tried to dispel the mob and secure the Capitol.\n\nBut three days later, Trump appears no more aware of the consequences of his actions than on the day of the riot when he delighted in the mayhem. Bunkered at the White House with an ever-shrinking circle of aides, he has offered no remorse for inciting the crowd and offered only a forced denunciation of their actions.

            "51": "U.S. House approves Capitol riot probe; many Republicans buck leadership\n\nWASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted to create an independent commission to probe the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by former President Donald Trump's supporters, as one in six Republicans defied party leaders' attempts to block it.\n\nOver the past two days, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell worked to kill a bipartisan bill to establish the commission to investigate the violence that left five dead including a Capitol Police officer.\n\nBut the House voted by 252-175 to approve the commission, which was styled after the panel that probed attacks on the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The bill now goes to the Senate where its future was uncertain.\n\nThe solid number of Republicans voting for the independent investigation -- 35 out of 211 -- signaled some cracks in the party's defense of Trump on a key vote. Trump opposes the creation of a commission.\n\nAll 10 of the House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January voted for the commission.\n\nThe bipartisan outcome could give Senate Republicans second thoughts about working to defeat the initiative.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Democrat, said McCarthy \"got what he asked for\" in a compromise on the structure of the commission, which would be charged with wrapping up its investigation by Dec. 31. McCarthy is a close ally of Trump.\n\nEarlier in the day, McConnell announced he would not support the House bill, calling it \"the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal\" and saying existing congressional investigations are sufficient.\n\nIn the 50-50 Senate - controlled by Democrats only because Vice President Kamala Harris can cast tie-breaking votes - Republicans can block the legislation. At least 60 votes are needed to advance most bills.\n\n\"There will continue to be no shortage of robust investigations,\" said McConnell, who in January said that the mob that attacked the Capitol was \"fed lies\" and \"provoked\" by Trump and others.\n\nPELOSI'S BACKUP PLAN\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said she could launch regular committee hearings with \"full subpoena power\" to investigate the riot if Senate Republicans block the commission.\n\n\"But that's not the path we have chosen to go,\" Pelosi added, explaining that a bipartisan, outside investigation was needed to win the public's trust in any findings.\n\nThe 10-member commission would produce a public report including recommendations for preventing another Capitol attack. It would be charged with examining security and intelligence failures surrounding the riot in which Trump's supporters, after he delivered an incendiary speech, interrupted the formal congressional certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory in the November election.\n\nDuring debate, Republican Representative John Katko said, \"An independent 9\/11-style review is critical for removing the politics around Jan. 6.\"\n\nKatko helped craft the legislation with House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat.\n\nThe House bill, unveiled last week, would give Republicans equal power with Democrats in appointing commissioners and equal say over witnesses.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said he will schedule a debate on the legislation. Schumer accused Republican leaders of \"caving to Donald Trump and proving that the Republican Party is still drunk off the Big Lie\" that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was stolen from Trump through massive voter fraud.",
            "52": "Donald Trump acquitted on charge of inciting US Capitol riot\n\nUS Senate fails to muster enough votes to convict the former president in his historic second impeachment trial.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump has been acquitted on a charge of \"incitement of insurrection\" in relation to the January 6 riot at the United States Capitol.\n\nAfter a five-day impeachment trial in the US Senate, the vote was largely split along party lines with 57 lawmakers voting to convict and 43 voting to acquit.\n\nThat fell short of the two-thirds Democrats needed to convict Trump, who is the only US president to ever be impeached twice while in office.\n\nNotably, however, seven Republican senators voted to convict the former president, the largest number of conviction votes from senators in president's own party for impeachment in US history.\n\nThis was Trump's second impeachment trial, the only time a president has been through this process twice. Trump's first impeachment trial, which took place in February 2020, ended in an acquittal of charges that he tried to pressure Ukraine to investigate now-President Joe Biden.\n\nThe second trial's outcome was not a surprise as the bar to convict would have required a significant bipartisan vote at a time when the US is extremely partisan \u2013 more deeply polarised politically than it has been in decades.\n\n\"This trial wasn't about choosing country over party, even not that this was about choosing country over Donald Trump and 43 Republican members chose Trump. They chose Trump,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said following the vote.\n\nTrump, for his part, released a statement calling the trial \"yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our Country.\"\n\n\"No president has ever gone through anything like it,\" Trump added.\n\nDemocrats had hoped that Republicans, who had experienced the riot first-hand and were deliberating at the scene of the crime, would cause them to put politics aside and vote for conviction.\n\nWhile the vote reflects the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats, it also magnifies the deep divisions within the GOP between pro-Trump lawmakers and those that feel he should be held accountable.\n\nThe arguments\n\nHouse Democratic impeachment managers framed their argument around the charge that Trump laid the groundwork for violence through his baseless insistence that the presidential election results were fraudulent. They laid out in detail evidence they argued showed he told the mob to come to Washington, DC on January 6, gave them their marching orders and then refrained from calling off the rioters after the violence started.\n\nThe Democrats played graphic videos of rioters storming the Capitol mixed with Trump's remarks he made and tweets he sent throughout. Over the course of two days, Democrats argued that it was plainly obvious that Trump incited the events that transpired on January 6.\n\n\"It's now clear beyond doubt that Trump supported the actions of the mob and so he must be convicted. It's that simple,\" lead House impeachment manager Jamie Raskin said during closing arguments on Saturday.\n\nTrump's defence team argued his speech was not \"incitement\" and was allowable under constitutional free-speech protections.\n\n\"To claim that the president in any way wished, desired or encouraged lawless or violent behaviour is a preposterous and monstrous lie,\" said Michael van der Veen, one of Trump's lawyers, on Friday.\n\nTrump's defence lawyers also argued that the Democrats' presentation was misleading, filled with \"doctored evidence\" and called the trial \"political theatre\" driven by Democrats who have had it out for Trump since he announced his first presidential campaign six years ago.\n\n\"Since my client stepped in, they have been possessed overwhelming zeal to vanquish an independent-minded outsider ... and to shame, demean, silence and demonize his supporters,\" van der Veen said during his closing arguments on Saturday.\n\nSpeedy trial\n\nLawmakers from both parties had hoped for a quick trial, and they received their wish. Five days is the fastest presidential impeachment trial, by far, in US history.",
            "53": "Capitol riot photos: what I saw inside the building when pro-Trump rioters took over.\n\nWhen Donald Trump told gathered supporters in D.C. Wednesday afternoon that \"we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, and we're going to the Capitol,\" they didn't wait. They started to march right away.\n\nEven as Trump continued to speak, I watched them begin to peel off, first a few, and then hundreds. One guy looked at me taking photographs and said, \"It's almost over. We have to get to the Capitol!\"\n\nThey moved quickly. The mood had been lighter earlier in the day, like a Trump-themed Comic-Con. But it darkened fast. Under banners like \"GOD, GUNS, GUTS & GLORY,\" protesters\u2014I was still thinking of them as protesters, not rioters, at that point\u2014screamed at counterprotesters along the side of the street, calling them \"cheaters\" and breaking into a steady, robotic chant of \"TRUMP WON! TRUMP WON!\"\n\nAs we got closer to the Capitol steps, there was some excitement: Fellow marchers had breached the building, people said. I wasn't sure what that meant. As we got closer, though, I saw these marchers ripping open doors and climbing through windows. When I got to the doors, police had managed to close them again. There was a core group of young people at the very front, just outside, trying to force their way in.\n\nThere were a few cops, but not nearly enough. As I approached the door, I identified myself as press, and one cop started using my body to push people behind me backward. I heard one say to the other, \"The best we can do is slow them down.\" I rolled around them and walked straight in.\n\nDirectly inside, I saw no cops. As \"Don't Stop Believin' \" blared from a speaker somewhere, large crowds chanted \"USA! USA!\" A man screamed about the American people's will. The entryway was already messed up. Rioters were smashing the windows, and there was wooden furniture piled up and destroyed. I saw a man in a conference room with his feet up. He and his friends were smoking weed, and when we clocked each other, they offered me a joint.\n\nIn another room, people were lounging and rummaging through furniture. They put up stickers and scrawled slogans like \"Trump Won\" and \"Our House.\" Some invited me to take their picture. One young guy put his feet up on one of the desks, posed, and told me, \"Yeah, this is my desk. I paid for this.\"\n\nAt one point, I'm pretty sure I saw Gavin McInnes, the Proud Boys founder, strolling around inside in military-style gear. Others seemed to notice too: I heard murmurs of \"Hey, it's Gavin.\" (Update, Jan. 7, 2021: McInnes says he was in New York on Wednesday and added: \"I was adamantly against this rally from day one.\") Not long after, a \"Boogaloo Boy\" who wouldn't give me his name shouted at me about currency and the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe mood was giddy, but it was chaos. Everyone was excited. People were chanting, \"This is our America,\" and \"Whose house? Our house!\" They were having fun, entertaining themselves. The priority seemed to be to have their friends take selfies with them inside the Capitol.\n\nThe people I managed to speak to didn't seem to understand the gravity of what they had done. Inside a building they had broken into, they described themselves as \"peaceful\" to me. I talked to a kid from Florida, who must have been no more than 17 or 18. He told me, \"This is nothing compared to what antifa does.\" I said, \"Look, they're breaking the glass.\" He answered, \"Yeah, but at least they're not destroying the things.\" I showed him pictures of things destroyed. It didn't register. On the way up, there was a woman holding a sign saying, \"If we were leftists, we would be rioting.\"\n\nEven amid the \"fun,\" there were some very aggressive rioters. People shouted \"fake news\" and attacked journalists. I saw a group of people scream at a female journalist who had an accent, \"Get out of my country!\" I got away with only one woman incensed I took her picture. I kept the picture and walked away. (I later learned that police shot and killed a woman inside, and there are frightening videos of rioters storming different parts of the building, but I wasn't there for either incident.)\n\nEventually, I did see some cops inside. They seemed to be standing by, waiting for orders. I've been to plenty of protests in the past year, and let me tell you: They don't usually wait for orders. I've never seen anything like it. There was a guy smoking a cigarette, and a cop actually walked over, gently placed his hand on the guy's shoulder, and asked him to put it out. And that was it.\n\nEventually, word must have come down. The cops started to smack through crowds with their batons and push them back. They pepper-sprayed people. Eventually, the officers retook the concourse outside the House side of the Capitol by using percussion grenades and tear gas. They had a fire extinguisher that appeared to be filled with pepper spray that they would explode in people's faces to keep them outside. By then, rioters were using barricades to try to smash back through the doors. They were trashing the place.\n\nOutside again, people were livid with the police. They chanted \"Traitors!\" and told them, \"We had your back. We're on your side!\" But the cops just stood there solemnly in their riot gear.",
            "54": "A timeline of what Donald Trump said before the Capitol riot\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, President Donald Trump repeatedly said he wanted his supporters to fight Congress on accepting the electoral college results that showed Joe Biden won.\n\n\"We're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women,\" Trump told his supporters shortly before the Capitol assault. \"We're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.\"\n\nHis supporters listened. Thousands of Trump supporters, waving Trump or Confederate flags and wearing MAGA gear, descended upon the Capitol. They overwhelmed law enforcement, pushed past police barricades, and temporarily stopped Congress from counting electoral votes.\n\nTrump's supporters had gathered earlier in the day for the \"Save America\" rally organized by a group called \"Women for America First.\" Trump allies, including former campaign staffers, helped promote the event, ABC News reported. Trump's White House schedule showed he was to speak at the rally that day.\n\nSome of Trump's fiercest allies also made incendiary statements at the rally. \"Let's have trial by combat,\" said Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Trump.\n\nWe looked closely at the words Trump used to urge his supporters to show up and \"fight\" on his behalf Jan. 6. With Trump's Twitter account permanently suspended, we used archives of his tweets by Factba.se and the Trump Twitter archive.\n\nWe contacted spokespersons for Trump and did not get a response.\n\nWhat Trump said before Jan. 6\n\nFor months before Election Day, Trump repeatedly told his supporters falsehoods about voting, including that Democrats had \"rigged\" the election. Trump ramped up the rhetoric after he lost the election, filing court challenges in battleground states trying to get judges to reverse the outcome. After he racked up defeats in court, Trump's tactics turned toward ordering senators to \"fight\" for him.\n\n\".@senatemajldr and Republican Senators have to get tougher, or you won't have a Republican Party anymore. We won the Presidential Election, by a lot. FIGHT FOR IT. Don't let them take it away!\" he tweeted Dec. 18.\n\nIn December, Trump also issued a battle cry to his supporters broadly, encouraging them to gather on his behalf Jan. 6.\n\nDec. 12: On the day of pro-Trump rallies in Washington, D.C., Trump tweeted \"Wow! Thousands of people forming in Washington (D.C.) for Stop the Steal. Didn't know about this, but I'll be seeing them! #MAGA.\"\n\nDec. 12: \"WE HAVE JUST BEGUN TO FIGHT!!!\" Trump said in another tweet.\n\nDec. 19: Trump tweeted his praise for a report by his adviser Peter Navarro alleging election fraud: \"A great report by Peter. Statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election. Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\n\nDec. 26: Trump tweeted: \"The 'Justice' Department and the FBI have done nothing about the 2020 Presidential Election Voter Fraud, the biggest SCAM in our nation's history, despite overwhelming evidence. They should be ashamed. History will remember. Never give up. See everyone in D.C. on January 6th.\"\n\nDec. 27: \"See you in Washington, DC, on January 6th. Don't miss it. Information to follow!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nJan. 1: \"The BIG Protest Rally in Washington, D.C., will take place at 11.00 A.M. on January 6th. Locational details to follow. StopTheSteal!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nJan. 1: \"January 6th. See you in D.C.\" Trump tweeted.\n\nJan. 3: Trump retweeted @JenLawrence21, an organizer of a March for Trump bus tour: \"Now we will bring it to DC on Jan 6 and PROUDLY stand beside you!\"\n\nJan. 3: Trump retweeted Amy Kremer, another promoter of the march who said, \"We are excited to announce the site of our January 6th event will be The Ellipse in the President's Park, just steps from the White House!\"\n\nJan. 3: Trump retweeted @CodeMonkeyZ: \"If you are planning to attend peaceful protests in DC on the 6th, i recommend wearing a body camera. The more video angles of that day the better.\"\n\nJan. 4: At a rally in Georgia the day before the Senate runoffs, Trump repeated his grievances about his own election. He spoke about a continued fight, both for himself and the Senate.\n\n\"If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House \u2014 and they're not taking this White House \u2014 we're going to fight like hell, I'll tell you right now,\" Trump said.\n\n\"We're going to take it back,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat Trump said before the riot\n\nTrump's final direction to supporters came during his \"Save America\" rally around noon Jan. 6, when he repeated his Pants on Fire claim that he won.\n\n\"Our country has had enough,\" Trump told his supporters. \"We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. To use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.\"\n\nThe crowd later chanted: \"Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump! Fight for Trump!\" Trump thanked them.\n\nTrump praised the crowd for traveling from across the nation and for \"the extraordinary love.\"\n\n\"We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: to save our democracy,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump repeatedly said there was a need to \"fight.\" After he bashed \"weak\" Republicans and Biden, he said: \"Unbelievable, what we have to go through, what we have to go through and you have to get your people to fight. If they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to let you know who they are, I can already tell you, frankly.\"\n\nHe continued with the fighting metaphors: \"Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer, and we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. We're going to have to fight much harder, and Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us. And if he doesn't, that will be a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our constitution. Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy.\"\n\nTrump then invited the crowd to go to the Capitol.",

Though most of the charges brought so far have been misdemeanors, acting U.S. Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday the Justice Department was considering bringing sedition charges against some of the rioters, effectively accusing them of attempting to overthrow or defeat the government.\n\n\"This is only the beginning,\" Sherwin said. \"We're going to focus on the most significant charges as a deterrent because, regardless of it was just a trespass in the Capitol or if someone planted a pipe bomb, you will be charged and you will be found.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has created a specialized strike force to examine the possibility of sedition charges, which could carry up to 20 years in prison.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called for the rioters to be added to a no-fly list, a tool most commonly associated with terrorisms investigations.\n\nThe statements by FBI and Justice Department officials on Tuesday were intended as both a defense of federal law enforcement preparations before the deadly riot and as a warning to participants. But they also raised new questions about the coordination across agencies for the Jan. 6 riot, which was sparked by Trump's calls for his supporters to fight Congress' vote confirming President-elect Joe Biden's victory.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the riot, some law enforcement officials, including the Capitol police chief, said they were unaware of serious concerns leading up to Jan. 6 and had prepared only for a free-speech protest.\n\nBut on Tuesday, The Washington Post reported on the existence of a Jan. 5 report from the FBI's field office in Norfolk, Virginia, that forecast, in detail, the chances that extremists could commit \"war\" in Washington the following day. Steven D'Antuono, the assistant director in charge of the FBI's Washington field office, said that once he received the Jan. 5 warning, the information was quickly shared with other law enforcement agencies through the joint terrorism task force.\n\nD'Antuono was among the officials who suggested law enforcement had simply been caught off guard, saying on Friday: \"There was no indication that there was anything other than First Amendment protected activity.\"\n\nHe did not explain the discrepancy in his statements, though he suggested Tuesday that the Norfolk warning was based on nonspecific information in terms of individual leads to investigate, characterizing it as a \"thread on a message board\" that was not attributable to any specific person.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday night, the FBI said the report's author had warned that the \"FBI might be encroaching on free speech rights\" in pursuing further action, and that the document itself did not necessarily associate the comments with a national security threat or crime. It highlighted D'Antuono's remarks at the news conference suggesting that without knowing the identity of the people whose words were cited in the report, there was not much that could be done with the information.\n\nU.S. Capitol Police and other official didn't immediately respond to questions about their own initial assessments of the threat.\n\nA U.S. defense official familiar with the discussions said Tuesday that Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy was not notified about the FBI warning.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that it is unclear whether any defense or military officials heard about the notification from the FBI, but that statements in recent days from all the leaders indicate they weren't aware that violence of that level was expected at the Capitol.",
            "60": "Police command structure crumbled fast during Capitol riot\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As the rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, many of the police officers had to decide on their own how to fight them off. There was no direction. No plan. And no top leadership.\n\nOne cop ran from one side of the building to another, fighting hand-to-hand against rioters. Another decided to respond to any calls of officers in distress and spent three hours helping cops who had been immobilized by bear spray or other chemicals.\n\nThree officers were able to handcuff one rioter. But a crowd swarmed the group and took the arrested man away with the handcuffs still on.\n\nInterviews with four members of the U.S. Capitol Police who were overrun by rioters on Jan. 6 show just how quickly the command structure collapsed as throngs of people, egged on by President Donald Trump, set upon the Capitol. The officers spoke on condition of anonymity because the department has threatened to suspend anyone who speaks to the media.\n\n\"We were on our own,\" one of the officers told The Associated Press. \"Totally on our own.\"\n\nThe officers who spoke to the AP said they were given next to no warning by leadership on the morning of Jan. 6 about what would become a growing force of thousands of rioters, many better armed than the officers themselves were. And once the riot began, they were given no instructions by the department's leaders on how to stop the mob or rescue lawmakers who had barricaded themselves inside. There were only enough officers for a routine day.\n\nThree officers told the AP they did not hear Chief Steven Sund on the radio the entire afternoon. It turned out he was sheltering with Vice President Mike Pence in a secure location for some of the siege. Sund resigned the next day.\n\nHis assistant chief, Yogananda Pittman, who is now interim chief, was heard over the radio telling the force to \"lock the building down,\" with no further instructions, two officers said.\n\nOne specific order came from Lt. Tarik Johnson, who told officers not to use deadly force outside the building as the rioters descended, the officers recounted. The order almost certainly prevented deaths and more chaos, but it meant officers didn't pull their weapons and were fighting back with fists and batons.\n\nJohnson has been suspended after being captured on video wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat while moving through crowds of rioters. Johnson told colleagues he wore the hat as a tactic to gain the crowd's confidence as he tried to reach other officers who were pinned down by rioters, one of the officers said. A video of the incident obtained by the Wall Street Journal shows Johnson asking rioters for help in getting his colleagues.\n\nJohnson, who could not be reached for comment, was heard by an officer on the radio repeatedly asking, \"Does anybody have a plan?\"",

            "65": "Investigators pursuing signs US Capitol riot was planned\n\nCNN \u2014 Evidence uncovered so far, including weapons and tactics seen on surveillance video, suggests a level of planning that has led investigators to believe the attack on the US Capitol was not just a protest that spiraled out of control, a federal law enforcement official says.\n\nAmong the evidence the FBI is examining are indications that some participants at the Trump rally at the Ellipse, outside the White House, left the event early, perhaps to retrieve items to be used in the assault on the Capitol.\n\nA team of investigators and prosecutors are also focused on the command and control aspect of the attack, looking at travel and communications records to determine if they can build a case that is similar to a counterterrorism investigation, the official said.\n\nThe belief, early in the probe, will demand significant investigation.\n\nThe presence of corruption prosecutors and agents is in part because of their expertise in financial investigations. \"We are following the money,\" the official said.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, the FBI reported that it had received more than 126,000 digital tips from the public regarding the attack on the Capitol \u2013 more than three times the number of tips received on Monday.\n\nAmong the thousands of tips the FBI received are some that appear to show members of Congress with people who later showed up at the Capitol riot, two law enforcement officials said. This doesn't mean members of Congress and staff are under investigation, but the FBI is checking the veracity of the claims, the officials said.\n\nCounterterrorism strategy for arrests\n\nAt least some of the arrests already made are part of a strategy used in counterterrorism investigations, to find even a minimal charge and try to take a person of concern off the streets. That helps ease the possible threat amid concern about possible attacks on the inauguration, officials believe.\n\nOn January 4, for example, local police arrested the leader of the Proud Boys, Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio, in Washington, DC.\n\nTarrio was taken into custody for allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after an earlier \"Stop the Steal\" rally. The Miami resident was charged with destruction of property related to the banner, however, federal authorities say they found Tarrio in possession of two high-capacity firearm magazines, prompting them to add a charge of Possession of High Capacity Feeding Device.\n\nOn Tuesday, federal authorities in New York City arrested Eduard Florea, 40, on at least one weapons charge after law enforcement, including the FBI and NYPD, responded to a Queens home in response to online postings about an armed caravan heading to the US Capitol, two law enforcement officials with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN that the man claims to be a Proud Boy and was arrested with live ammunition in the home.\n\nAlready, the public efforts by prosecutors and the FBI to encourage people who participated In the riot to turn themselves in is yielding fruit. Some attorneys have reached out to arrange for safe surrender of their clients in order to gain a measure of leniency and lessen the chance of a police raid on their homes, two officials said.\n\nFor instance, a counterterrorism prosecutor even appeared in court for an early hearing for one of the defendants on Tuesday, signaling how integrated the Justice Department's effort already is between the typical criminal prosecutors who handle initial criminal hearings and with the units focused on more complex crimes.\n\n\"With this strike force that was established to focus strictly on sedition charges, we're looking at in treating this just like a significant international counterterrorism or counterintelligence operation,\" DC US Attorney Michael Sherwin said Tuesday.\n\n\"We're looking at everything: money, travel records. Looking at disposition, movement, communication records. So no resource related to the FBI, or the US Attorney's Office will be unchecked in terms of trying to determine exactly if there was a command and control how it operated and how they executed these, these activities.\"",

Ron Johnson in recent weeks as he has sought to downplay the violence committed by supporters of former President Donald Trump.\n\nTestifying publicly for the first time since pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol nearly two months ago, Wray was pressed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin on whether the FBI has seen any evidence that individuals involved in the January 6 attack were posing as Trump supporters \u2013 a claim the Illinois Democrat called \"the next big lie.\"\n\n\"We have not seen evidence of that, at this stage, certainly,\" Wray responded when Durbin asked if he had seen any evidence the riot was organized by \"fake Trump protesters,\" referring to comments Johnson made during a Senate hearing last week in which he also claimed those involved in the attack were \"agents provocateurs.\"\n\nMost Republicans on the panel did not embrace these conspiracies, but the baseless claim that left-wing infiltrators were responsible for the violent attack has been promoted by Trump's impeachment lawyers, several GOP lawmakers and at least one speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference last week.\n\nOn Tuesday, Wray made clear that Antifa and other left-wing groups were not part of the violence on January 6, which he called \"domestic terrorism\" \u2013 even as several Republicans sought to use the hearing as an opportunity to highlight the threat posed by those groups rather than focus on the Capitol attack.\n\n\"We have not, to date, seen any evidence of anarchist violent extremists or people subscribing to Antifa in connection to the 6th,\" Wray told the Senate committee.\n\nMore than 260 defendants \u2013 many of them professing allegiance to Trump, disgust for Congress, and supportive of revolution \u2013 have been charged in federal court related to their actions in and around the US Capitol siege on January 6.\n\nPreviously, nearly a dozen Trump supporters charged in connection with the US Capitol insurrection have said that Antifa and other left-wing groups weren't involved in the attack, further debunking the conspiracy among Trump supporters.\n\nAdditionally, Wray testified Tuesday that the FBI is \"not aware of any widespread evidence of voter fraud that would have affected the outcome in the election,\" undercutting a false narrative that was repeatedly pushed by Trump and his allies during the 2020 campaign.\n\nMany Republicans on Capitol Hill have continued to push unfounded accusations of widespread election fraud, which Trump critics have taken to calling \"the Big Lie,\" in the weeks since the January 6 attack despite evidence that such claims helped fuel the deadly riot and warnings they continue to motivate domestic extremists.\n\nWray dodges opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse QAnon\n\nWhile Wray spent much of Tuesday's hearing dispelling dangerous false claims, he dodged an opportunity to denounce lawmakers who endorse the QAnon conspiracy theories.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said he was \"disappointed\" Wray sidestepped an opportunity to condemn elected officials who have amplified the QAnon claims when asked if they are contributing to the threat of domestic extremism by doing so.\n\n\"Well, certainly we are concerned about the QAnon phenomenon which we view as a sort of loose, sort of set of conspiracy theories, and we've certainly seen domestic violent extremists of the sort that you're describing, who cite that as part of their motivation.

There is no evidence of widespread fraud, but Trump and many of his conservative allies in the media and on Capitol Hill have continued to push the \"big lie\" regardless.\n\nCalling into Fox News on Thursday night, Trump was asked if he was concerned about the US Capitol's beefed up security, including razor-wire fencing, which he derided as \"disgraceful\" and a \"political maneuver.\"\n\n\"It was zero threat, right from the start, it was zero threat. Look, they went in, they shouldn't have done it. Some of them went in, and they are hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they had great relationships,\" Trump told Fox News' Laura Ingraham. \"A lot of the people were waved in, and then they walked in and they walked out.\"\n\nTrump's latest whitewash attempt comes after the world has been presented with reams of video evidence of the violence that broke out on January 6, criminal charges filed against participants, law enforcement officials testimony, police officers' accounts of the violence, and lawmakers' descriptions of the fear they experienced that day.\n\nTrump appeared to suggest that some of the rioters should face repercussions, but quickly pivoted to attacking the leftist movement Antifa, a familiar target of his that he has often cited to draw a false equivalency in downplaying crimes committed in his name.\n\n\"They're persecuting a lot of those people, and some of them should be \u2013 some things should happen to them. But when I look at Antifa in Washington, even, what they did to Washington and what they did to other locations and the destruction, and frankly, the killing and the beating up of people, and nothing happens to them whatsoever. Why aren't they going after Antifa?\" Trump told Fox News.\n\nIngraham then interjected. \"But you would say that people who commit crimes, regardless of what their political affiliations are, should be prosecuted?\"\n\n\"Absolutely. What you said is exactly right,\" Trump replied.\n\nThe mob of pro-Trump supporters who stormed the US Capitol intended to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden's win in the 2020 election.",
            "71": "Leaders of pro-Trump groups Oath Keepers, Proud Boys subpoenaed in Jan. 6 Capitol riot probe\n\nThe House select committee investigating the deadly Capitol invasion said Tuesday it issued subpoenas to the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, two far-right organizations whose members were involved with the Jan. 6 attack. The committee also subpoenaed Proud Boys leader Henry \"Enrique\" Tarrio and Oath Keepers President Elmer Stewart Rhodes, along with 1st Amendment Praetorian, another organization involved with the lead-up to Jan. 6. The latest batch of subpoenas follows dozens of other requests from the House committee for documents and testimony from witnesses believed to have tangible connections to Jan. 6 and the events that precipitated it. The bipartisan panel is probing the facts and factors that caused the riot, when hundreds of former President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol, temporarily halting efforts to confirm President Joe Biden's Electoral College victory. The invasion followed months of false claims from Trump that the 2020 election was rigged against him. \"We believe the individuals and organizations we subpoenaed today have relevant information about how violence erupted at the Capitol and the preparation leading up to this violent attack,\" select committee chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said in a press release.",
            "72": "A Damning New Report Finally Explains the Strangest Thing I Saw Inside the Capitol Riot\n\nWhen I walked toward the Capitol on Jan. 6 alongside Donald Trump's supporters and heard some of them had breached the building ahead, I expected the situation to escalate sharply. I expected police in military gear and a response as aggressive as I've come to anticipate covering and observing protests over the past year, where a single water bottle thrown at a cop line can bring a volley of tear gas and percussion grenades in retaliation.\n\nInstead, I easily walked into the Capitol perimeter. At the entrances to the building, there were a few Capitol Police officers helplessly trying to hold a line at the doors, but they were vastly outnumbered. The officers had somehow gotten the doors back closed, but within minutes, rioters were easily pushing past them again. Once I was inside, too, I saw no officers at all for a stretch, as rioters plundered and destroyed furniture. When I did, it was even more surreal: They looked as if they were there loitering themselves. Some were equipped with riot gear, others not, but most just stood there and watched. Some rioters stopped to ask them for directions. In one of the only direct interactions I saw, a Capitol officer asked a rioter to put out a cigarette, then walked away.\n\nI'd never seen law enforcement show this level of restraint at any protest, much less a riot. And now we know why. A damning new report by the Capitol Police's own inspector general, Michael A. Bolton, presented at a Capitol Hill hearing today, portrays a police force that recklessly disregarded intelligence and hobbled its own response at every turn.\n\nWith around 140 officers injured and one dead, there was some passing of the buck in the immediate aftermath of the riot. Republicans were in denial. The former Capitol Police chief, Steven Sund, resigned almost immediately. He wrote in a letter, \"Perfect hindsight does not change the fact that nothing in our collective experience or our intelligence\u2014Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and D.C. Metropolitan Police (MPD)\u2014indicated that a well-coordinated, armed assault on the Capitol might occur on Jan. 6.\" Sund repeated this assertion in testimony in front of a U.S. Senate committee just weeks ago: \"None of the intelligence we received predicted what actually occurred,\" he said.\n\nThat account stands in direct contrast to the new report, in which Bolton found that Capitol Police leadership dismissed threat assessments and forbade rank-and-file officers from appropriately responding to the threat. The New York Times reviewed a copy of the document and reported that the Capitol Police's own intelligence warned three days before that \"Congress itself is the target on the 6th.\" There were warnings about who would be in the crowd: \"Stop the Steal's propensity to attract white supremacists, militia members and others who actively promote violence may lead to a significantly dangerous situation for law enforcement and the general public alike.\" Bolton's report also unearthed pre-insurrection warnings from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, which had relayed to the Capitol Police that a map of the Capitol's tunnel system had turned up on pro-Trump message boards.\n\nBut the 104-page report found that, rather than ramp up security, the officers on duty were ordered to carry only limited riot-prevention equipment and to not carry stun grenades. Bolton wrote that \"heavier less-lethal weapons were not used that day because of orders from leadership.\" He added that the unit was \"operating at a decreased level of readiness as a result of a lack of standards for equipment\" that diminished \"operational readiness.\"",

            "74": "Whether Trump 'incited' Capitol riot is in eye of the beholder\n\nIt should be easy to make the political argument Trump's words are at fault. Legally, it will be more difficult.\n\nAs thousands clad in Donald Trump hats and wielding Trump flags stormed the US Capitol last Wednesday, it was Trump's own words just prior to the riot urging them to \"fight\" that is being blamed for the violence that ensued.\n\nAccording to the House resolution laying out the article of impeachment the US House of Representatives is expected to debate this week, it was Trump's speech at the Ellipse, just across the street from the White House, that is the evidence for their allegation that Trump \"engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States\".\n\nThe resolution states that \"shortly before the Joint Session\" to count the Electoral College votes and certify President-elect Joe Biden's victory \"commenced, President Trump ... reiterated false claims that 'we won this election, and we won it by a landslide'\".\n\n\"He also willfully made statements that, in context, encouraged \u2013 and foreseeably resulted in \u2013 lawless action at the Capitol, such as: 'if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore',\" the resolution continues.\n\n\"Thus incited by President Trump, members of the crowd he addressed ... unlawfully breached and vandalized the Capitol, injured and killed law enforcement personnel, menaced Members of Congress, the Vice President, and Congressional personnel, and engaged in other violent, deadly, destructive, and seditious acts.\"\n\nThe House impeachment effort boils down to Trump's uttering of \"if you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore\".\n\nImpeachment versus legal guilt\n\nThe impeachment process is inherently a political one, not a legal one, meaning while members of Congress generally refer to legal language when considering whether a president committed \"high crimes and misdemeanours\", there is no requirement that Congress needs to legally prove that the accused is guilty of those crimes, though generally there is a lot of effort to gather as much evidence as possible.\n\nBecause the process is driven by politics, it is therefore driven by American sentiment towards the accused president and whether a majority of Americans agree with the accusations. In this case, a poll released on Sunday is the first indication that impeaching Trump might not be a very controversial move.\n\nIn the ABC News\/Ipsos poll, 67 percent of Americans said Trump deserves a great deal or good amount of blame for the riot, including 69 percent of independents but only 31 percent of Republicans.\n\nThe same poll suggested that 56 percent of Americans think Trump should be removed from office before his term ends on January 20.\n\nThat is a significant difference from when Congress impeached but failed to remove Trump from office in 2019-2020. Last year, Americans were split throughout the entire process, with a clear majority never materialising to punish Trump.\n\nThe difference in Americans' opinions is a likely indicator the process this time around could move more quickly with much less controversy. Certainly, the political winds will give members who vote to impeach significant political cover against those who argue this process is happening too quickly, dispensing with the traditional lengthy investigation and deliberation given to previous successful impeachment efforts.\n\nBut just because Congress says Trump is guilty of \"inciting\" the riot, does not mean he is guilty in the eyes of the law. Congress's actions could result in Trump being removed from office or preventing him from holding office again, but it does not meet the legal bar of actually holding him liable for the illegal behaviour and destruction of the Capitol caused by the rioters.\n\nAnd that legal bar is quite high, according to experts.\n\nThe former District of Columbia assistant attorney general, Jeffrey Scott Shapiro, who has experience successfully \u2013 and unsuccessfully \u2013 convicting protesters for incitement, argues Trump did not violate any incitement laws with his speech.\n\nShapiro, who currently serves as a Trump appointee to the US Agency for Global Media, pointed out in a Wall Street Journal op-ed on Sunday: \"In the District of Columbia, it's a crime to 'intentionally or recklessly act in such a manner to cause another person to be in reasonable fear' and to 'incite or provoke violence where there is a likelihood that such violence will ensue'.\"\n\nIn addition to the \"fight\" language the House resolution cites, Shapiro mentions that another of Trump's lines from his speech is being held up as evidence of incitement: \"We're going to cheer on brave senators and congressmen and -women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them. Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\"",
            "75": "US Capitol riot: How CNN obtained the dramatic videos of the January 6 attack\n\nCNN \u2014 Words can only describe so much from the nearly 500 criminal cases against rioters who overtook the US Capitol on January 6.\n\nHours of media and live-streamed participant video have been available since that day, capturing crowds mounting scaffolding built for Inauguration Day, Trump supporters gleefully running through the building's hallways and the Senate chamber, and even the death of one participant shot by a police officer through a doorframe. But much of the most significant video capturing the most severe violent crimes from that day still can't be seen.\n\nThat's because the Justice Department and the federal courts haven't proactively made available footage from surveillance cameras around the Capitol and from DC Metropolitan police officers' body cameras.\n\nLast week, the public finally began to see some of that video, because a group of 16 major media outlets led by CNN sued for access. The video releases \u2013 just a few in the media coalitions' continued pursuit of dozens \u2013 come as some Republicans, inspired by former President Donald Trump's election lies, are denying what happened on January 6, despite injured law enforcement officers like DC Police's Michael Fanone pushing for officials to acknowledge the Trump supporters' unlawful brutality that day.\n\nThe effort to get footage released has taken months. In some cases, the videos became evidence in public portions of Capitol riot defendants' cases weeks ago. But it hasn't even been seen by reporters covering the court proceedings because of the peculiarities of video technology, the unprecedented sweep of the insurrection investigation and structural approaches in the federal court system.\n\nRolling the tapes in court\n\nCNN's work to view video used in court began in March. Two months after the insurrection, federal defendants were appearing in court each day by the dozen. As defendants came through DC District Court following their arrests in their home states, judges held waves of hearings about whether to detain each of them. At those hearings, prosecutors needed to prove the alleged dangerousness of each defendant, showing how violent some were on January 6, especially toward police. The best way to do it, in many cases: Roll the January 6 tapes.\n\nThe tapes showed from police officers' perspectives and unflinching surveillance cameras the violence of the pro-Trump crowd \u2013 law enforcement colleagues beaten and dragged and crushed in doorframes; police lines collapsing, completely overwhelmed.\n\nTypically the court press corps sits in the courthouse to watch hearings where these moments are laid out in excruciating detail. But because of coronavirus restrictions, we could only listen to DC federal court proceedings over the phone. The judges, lawyers and defendants, however, recreated their courtrooms over Zoom videoconferences.\n\nAnother technological hitch kept these videos out of sight: While most evidence used in early federal criminal proceedings gets posted on an online public docket, called Pacer, that system can't house videos.\n\nAs these limitations became more apparent every day, CNN and other news outlets started pushing for access. Thousands of hours of video became core to the Justice Department's prosecution of the siege \u2013 an overwhelming trove of evidence that would be rolled out gradually to prove scene by scene the behavior of hundreds of rioters.\n\nIn one case, against riot defendant Emanuel Jackson, NBC wrote to his judge and received limited access to a video from the case. In another, Judge Royce Lamberth ordered the court to post videos on its website from the case against the so-called \"Q Anon Shaman\" Jacob Chansley, who had become famous for posing with a horned headdress and a spear-tipped flagpole at the vice president's desk in the Senate.\n\nThen the Justice Department arrested two pro-Trump ralliers for spraying Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who later died, and two other officers with mace-like chemicals along the police line at the front of the Capitol building. It was a significant break in a major January 6 assault case.\n\nThe West Virginia court where one defendant, George Tanios, first appeared allowed reporters to view his detention hearing as a livestream video. Prosecutors played videos of the Sicknick attack one after another, showing how each officer physically reacted to the assault. The judge in West Virginia, Michael Aloi, called the video of Sicknick \"surreal\" and noted how he was impacted by the severity of the chemical spray hitting the officers' faces.",

Bush, said: \"The government's filing sends a clear message... No leader in our government is acting within the scope of his employment when he acts to subvert the free and fair election by getting people to go up and riot and interfere.\"\n\n\"The leaders who perpetrated these travesties are personally responsible for their actions.\" he added.

Addressing Americans about congressional action is a quintessential presidential duty.\"\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nThe department riled some Democrats, with a pair of recent decisions that seemed to shield Trump or members of his administration, though legal experts said the moves were intended to protect the office of the presidency, not its former occupant.\n\nTrump's primary legal defense in the Swalwell suit has not rested on the Westfall Act but on a legal doctrine that argues the separation of powers in the U.S. Constitution broadly grants the president immunity during his time in office.\n\n\"Rousing and controversial speeches are a key function of the presidency. That is especially true when, as is the case here, the President is advocating for or against congressional action,\" his lawyer wrote in a May 24 filing.\n\nIn a footnote, the lawyer added: \"Even if former President Trump is not covered by absolute immunity, as a governmental actor, the claims against him are also foreclosed by immunity under the Westfall Act.\"\n\nAttorney Anne Tindall of the advocacy group Protect Democracy said the department's filing contains a lot of signs that are \"bad news for Trump.\"\n\n\"Trump's role is even more limited than Brooks' is,\" said Tindall, who is representing two Capitol Police officers in a separate lawsuit alleging Trump incited the riot.",

A profane piece of hate mail addressed her as a domestic terrorist. She even became a punchline for Stephen Colbert's late-night talk show on CBS.\n\nA swift backlash greeted Capitol riot suspects like Bauer when they returned to their homes across the U.S. after joining the mob that stormed past police barricades, smashed windows and disrupted the certification of Joe Biden's presidential victory on Jan. 6. Relatives, friends or co-workers reported scores of them to the FBI. Some lost jobs. Others lost their freedom, jailed awaiting trials.\n\nIn Bauer's hometown in rural Pennsylvania, her arrest and that of a longtime friend have rekindled partisan bickering, more often on social media than on street corners, some residents say.

Democrats are now calling on formal investigations, citing an unusual uptick in visitors sporting MAGA gear the day before the attempted coup. But few other details have been released.\n\n\"Let's be clear, there's no way those groups could have gotten into the Capitol without a Member of Congress or a staff member of a member of Congress,\" said U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat from New Jersey.\n\nCapitol riot arrests: See who has been charged\n\nHere's a breakdown of what we know so far:\n\nWhat's been alleged?\n\nSome members of Congress, including those who say they're trained to spot suspicious activity from their time in the military, said in a letter that they witnessed an usual number of outside groups visiting the complex on Jan. 5, the day before the riot. They allege some of those visitors may have been involved in the deadly insurrection the following day.\n\nThe letter, which demands that the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police investigate the link between those visitors and the subsequent violence in the Capitol, garnered more than 30 signatures.\n\nThose lawmakers say that the building has been mostly closed to the public since March 2020 and cited \"a concerning departure from the procedures\" the day before the riot. The letter also notes that these visitors appeared to be associated with the Trump rally, but offered no other details. It goes on to question whether there were any sign-ins, logbooks, video footage or facial recognition software available. The letter also questions the tracking involved for staff members who want to bring official guests into the building and which other agencies have potentially accessed these records.\n\nSome members of Congress grew suspicious because the only people who could have facilitated such tours, they contend, are fellow lawmakers. One Democrat said the emergency call buttons were removed from her office. Another said pipe bombs found earlier in the day were a clear diversionary tactic to get Capitol Police to leave the perimeter. Many have also questioned how the rioters knew their way around the maze of the Capitol so quickly and why only liberal offices appear to have been targeted.\n\n\"Stop the Steal\" organizer Ali Alexander further exacerbated these theories when he claimed that three Republican House members \u2013 Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar of Arizona and Mo Brooks of Alabama \u2013 had helped him plan the rally. Biggs and Brooks have explicitly denied a role. Gosar has not commented on his alleged involvement.\n\nWho is investigating?\n\nCongressional Democrats have asked the House Sergeant at Arms, Senate Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police to investigate the link between the visitors and riots. It's unclear exactly where that status of that probe stands. Other agencies, including the FBI and Metropolitan Police, have helped with criminal investigations into the various individuals arrested, but it's unclear if they're examining the possible connections to GOP lawmakers.\n\nWho was involved in the tours?\n\nThe Democrats haven't named names, but some have suggested the visitors mostly consisted of Trump supporters, which would not necessarily be usual taken by itself. It's also not clear if they spotted individual members of Congress helping get anyone inside.\n\nU.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, told reporters in the Capitol Wednesday he'd heard names of lawmakers who gave tours but didn't want to say until he got verification. \"I don't want to throw any member under the bus,\" he said.\n\nFederal law and safety rules amid the coronavirus pandemic prohibit members of the public from entering the building. All public tours have been canceled since March 2020, and only lawmakers, staff, media and their guests with proper credentials are allowed in.\n\n\"Who's responsible for this thing?\" said Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minnesota. \"Because clearly, long before any speeches were being made down by the White House, something was already afoot up here.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Vern Buchanan, R-Florida, said he did not see anything like what Rep. Sherrill and others have alleged, calling her allegations \"hard to believe.\"\n\n\"Congresswoman Sherrill's claims of a criminal conspiracy by unnamed members of Congress is startling and hard to believe,\" Buchanan said. \"If she has evidence that a member of Congress conducted 'reconnaissance tours' to help the rioters plan last week's attack she needs to release it immediately. I saw nothing of the kind when I was on the House floor that week and would be shocked to learn it was true.\"\n\nIs there evidence that rioters targeted Black lawmakers, Pelosi and other specific members?\n\nPictures and video show one rioter trotting through the halls of Congress with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's stolen lectern tucked under his arm.

Instead, Citi (C)bank accidentally wired almost 100 times that amount, including $175 million to a hedge fund. In all, Citi (C) accidentally sent $900 million to Revlon's lenders.\n\nSome lenders did return the money, but others did not. Citibank filed a lawsuit in August seeking the return of its funds, but it still has not received $500 million from 10 investment advisory firms after the accidental transfer.\n\nAn exception to the rule\n\nThe law usually punishes those who spend money accidentally deposited in their accounts. Accidental transfers are common in the digital age, and wires can be paid back instantly. A Pennsylvania couple faced felony charges after spending money accidentally deposited in their account.\n\nBut New York law has exceptions to this rule, known as the \"discharge-for-value-defense.\"\n\nIf the beneficiary is entitled to the money and did not know it was accidentally wired, they can keep it. Revlon lenders said they believed Citibank was wiring prepayments for a loan. After all, the money accidentally wired was the exact amount \"to the penny\" Citibank owed them, although the loan wasn't set to mature for quite some time.\n\n\"We are extremely pleased with Judge [Jesse] Furman's thoughtful, thorough and detailed decision,\" said Benjamin Finestone, who represented two lenders, Brigade and HPS Investment Partners.\n\n'Borderline irrational'\n\nThe court ruled the lenders were justified in believing the payment was intentional.

In the chat, which was dated a day after the mistaken wiring, HPS employees joked about the error:\n\nDFREY5: I feel really bad for the person that fat fingered a $900mm erroneous payment.

Though the law generally requires money mistakenly wired to be returned to its sender, Furman in his ruling cited an exception in New York that allows recipients to keep funds if they discharge a valid debt and if the recipient is not aware of the mistake upon its receipt of the funds. Because the payment was applied to existing loans, and the lenders did not make any misrepresentations to induce the accidental repayment, Furman said the wire transfers were \"final and complete transactions\" and not subject to revocation. The decision follows what Furman called \"one of the biggest blunders in banking history\": a full loan repayment of $893 million that Citibank mistakenly wired when it simply intended to pay approximately $7.8 million in interest (some lenders returned part of the overpayment). In an emailed statement to Forbes, Citigroup said it \"strongly disagrees\" with the court's decision and intends to appeal the ruling. Shares of Citigroup are edging up 0.7% Tuesday, pushing the stock's one-year gain to about 6.5%.\n\nKey Background\n\nThe blunder in August added fuel to regulatory scrutiny facing Citigroup over its internal record-keeping practices, and in October the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined the bank $400 million for deficiencies in risk management, data governance and internal controls. After the bank's accidental repayment, a slew of lawsuits against receiving lenders helped Citi recoup about $400 million from the accidental repayment.\n\nCrucial Quote\n\n\"It appears that no mistake of the size or nature of Citibank's had ever happened before . . . [and] faced with these circumstances, the non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,\" Furman ruled on Friday. \"Indeed, to believe otherwise\u2014to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion\u2014would have been borderline irrational.\"\n\nChief Critic",

Instead of transferring a $7.8 million interest payment to the cosmetic company's lenders, the bank transferred the full loan amount.\n\nThe bank notified the creditors within 24 hours that it had not intended to pay the full amount, which was not due until 2023. Some firms returned the money, but 10 others refused to return about $500 million of the funds, prompting Citigroup's failed lawsuit to recoup the payment.\n\nThe blunder was the result of the failure to check the right boxes for the wire transfer\n\nCitigroup \u2014 like many commercial banks \u2014 uses Flexcube, a third-party application system from Oracle designed to help perform tasks like wire transfers.\n\nCitigroup subcontractors are responsible for entering the transaction information into the Flexcube database in order to initiate the transfer process.\n\nOn Flexcube, the easiest way to perform a transaction is to enter the principal amount into the system. The principal amount is directed to a \"wash account\" within the bank, while the payment triggers the interest to be sent out automatically to lenders.\n\nFor the Revlon payment, the subcontractor in India checked the box labeled \"principal\" and entered the digits for an internal Citigroup wash account. Three people signed off on the transaction.\n\n\"Looks good, please proceed. Principal is going to wash,\" the supervisor wrote when he approved the transaction, according to the court filing.\n\nThe mistake was not realized till the next morning when the full amount was sent out to the 10 different creditors.\n\nIt turned out, the subcontractor needed to check two more boxes. In order to send the principal payment to the wash account, the subcontractor must also check the boxes for \"front\" and \"fund,\" setting them to the internal Citigroup account as well.\n\n\"Minor changes\" to Flexcube could have spared the bank from the blunder altogether\n\nKhmelevskiy's agency has worked with several large scale tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Slack. He said there are many ways the platform could have been improved to avoid the $500 million mistake.\n\n\"Even if we put the look and feel aside, just adding more clear instructions for each field and using more human-friendly language and terms would improve it drastically,\" Khmelevskiy said. \"Even a minor change such as a confirmation dialog with an overview of what is about to happen could help Citi avoid making this mistake.\"\n\nIn his decision, the judge said he hoped other banks would learn from Citigroup's mistake and implement more steps to minimize the risk of errors \u2014 an accident which the judge calls the result of a \"fat finger.\"\n\nThe judge based his ruling off a previous case, stating that it was reasonable for the creditors to keep the funds because they matched what the lenders were owed.\n\n\"To believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion \u2014 would have been borderline irrational\" Furman said in the ruling.",

Three employees using poorly designed software accidentally sent $900 million to one of its client's creditors instead of $7.8 million \u2014 then when creditors refused to return most of the money, a judge ruled in favor of the creditors.\n\nThe judge blamed \"human error\" in his decision, pointing out that:\n\nThe instruction manual for the banking software, Flexcube, explained how to perform this kind of transaction.\n\nCiti uses a \"six eyes process\" \u2014 meaning that three Citi employees reviewed Flexcube's transfer screen, to approve the transaction.\n\nFlexcube warned that funds would be sent out of the bank, but not the amount.\n\nHowever, that explanation misses the bigger picture: If three experienced employees agree on what they expect the software will do, but it does something else, that indicates an interaction design defect that caused the human error.\n\nAvoiding mistakes is one of the six ways better employee user experience (UX) drives better business results. It's rarely as dramatic as a single $500 million incident \u2014 at most companies, it's a steady drumbeat of avoidable mistakes that cost time and money and could have been prevented through better UX design. This is a design debt interest payment that almost every business is paying day after day, year after year.\n\nThe Design For Work Opportunity\n\nBusinesses are waking up to the upside opportunity in improving UX design for employees. Already, about half of design teams work on employee-facing software. And based on Forrester's analysis of the $150 billion-plus design industry, that number is going to grow.\n\nCiti has many dedicated professionals working on UX for its consumer app and site, both of which are much better designed than that screen in Flexcube, based on Forrester's UX reviews of apps and sites for banking customers. Citi probably even has a team dedicated to employee-facing software as most large firms do. However, that team is probably overstretched and wishes they'd had the chance to improve this interaction in Flexcube. If you were Citi, wouldn't you invest in fixing that defect right now? How many other UX issues lurk inside of businesses waiting to cause major or minor mistakes? And how many other companies are in the same boat? Again, this is interest paid on Citi's design debt \u2014 and it's likely to come due again.\n\nIt's not just internal teams either \u2014 software vendors are being forced to improve UX or face dire consequences. How would you like to be Flexcube right now, knowing that your product caused a customer to lose $500M, and that your competitors are telling all your prospects about it? And consider just how much frustrating software employees interact with every day. Every single one of the vendors of those tools is at risk of being abandoned in favor of a better designed replacement. Just look at commerce suites, for one example among many.\n\nThere have been plenty of major mistakes caused by bad UX before, of course: The tragic accident of the USS John McCain in 2017 that was caused by confusing controls; the Hawaii nuclear missile test warning gone awry in 2018; Three Mile Island's 1979 meltdown exacerbated by a convoluted control room. And there are minor ones every day that affect us. These issues are everywhere and at every scale.\n\nMaking It Better Requires Effort And Expertise \u2014 And Pays Off\n\nSo what's the first step to improving this situation? Recognizing there's a problem: Our research has found that most organizations assume employees will use whatever tool they're asked to, so most companies put minimal effort into design as long as the functionality exists, even if it's unnecessarily convoluted and obscure. They may have been able to get away with that in the past \u2014 but less and less so, now.",
            "92": "The Lessons From Citibank's Mistaken $900 Million Transfer\n\nI read this story about Citibank's mistaken transfer\u2014which cost it about half a billion dollars\u2014a while back, and the sheer improbability of the mistake struck me. How could a banking giant make a blunder of such staggering magnitude despite multiple checks and balances? So what exactly went wrong here?\n\nI recently circled back to that story and realized that it was, unsurprisingly, more complicated than it had sounded at first blush. Nevertheless, as software developers and software users, I suspected we could learn quite a bit from this expensive mistake along with our customers.\n\nI want to unpack a few of those lessons\u2014but first, let's review what happened.\n\nICYMI: What Happened in the Citibank Wire Transfer Case\n\nThe bare-bones version of the story goes like this: Citibank, acting as the administrative agent for Revlon's loan, meant to process $7.8 million in interest payments to Revlon's lenders. However, Citibank's software system required that it set up and execute what was, in effect, a \"dummy\" transaction to process the interest payment. Citibank would create a transfer of the entire outstanding balance, including both principal and interest, into an internally held \"wash account.\" Citibank's staff had to check not just one clearly labeled box but also two other boxes with cryptic and confusing labels to direct the funds to the internal account. Because they only checked the one box, the money, totaling about $900 billion, didn't go to the wash account\u2014it was wired straight to the creditors. (A rather large oops!)\n\nCitibank realized its error within 24 hours and asked the lenders to return the mistakenly transferred money. Some did, but several lenders refused due to a strange quirk of New York law: the \"discharge-for-value\" exception. This defense applies when someone receives a payment that is, in fact, owed to them. That recipient can keep mistakenly sent funds so long as\n\nthe recipient did not fraudulently induce the payment and\n\nthe recipient did not realize at the time of receipt that the money was sent by mistake.\n\nCitibank filed a lawsuit to recover the unreturned funds, which totaled about $500 million. Most of the facts in the litigation were simple. First, Revlon did owe its creditors, though the total amount was not due until 2023. Second, the payments the lenders received were correct payoff amounts, down to the penny. Third, the lenders\u2014who weren't even expecting payments\u2014did nothing to induce the payoff. So the only real question for the court was whether the lenders immediately realized that Citibank made a mistake when it sent the payments.\n\n...the only real question for the court was whether the lenders immediately realized that Citibank made a mistake when it sent the payments.",

We believe we are entitled to the funds and will continue to pursue a complete recovery of them,\" Citigroup said in a statement.",
            "94": "Citigroup's $900 Million Defeat\n\nCiti's expensive day in court\n\nCitigroup made a huge mistake last summer, when instead of transferring an $8 million interest payment from Revlon to its creditors, it transferred nearly $900 million of the bank's own funds \u2014 the full amount of principal on the loan that wasn't due for another few years. Some creditors promptly returned $400 million of the mistakenly wired money, but 10 others refused to return $500 million. The dispute ended up in court.\n\nYesterday, unexpectedly, a New York federal judge said the firms could keep the cash, despite acknowledging that the money had been transferred in error.\n\nWait, what? The lenders argued that the transfers matched what they were owed, so they could have \"reasonably thought the payments were intentional,\" assuming that it would be \"downright irrational\" for Citi to make such a big mistake, the judge, Jesse Furman, concluded. He might have ruled differently if he could \"write on a blank slate,\" but there were legal precedents supporting the defendants.\n\n\"New York law wants to discourage banks from making these kinds of mistakes,\" said Adam Abensohn of Quinn Emanuel, who represented the asset managers. \"It's one thing to mistakenly send money to someone with no entitlement to that payment,\" he told DealBook. \"But there is nothing unfair about keeping that money when it's owed.\"\n\n\"At its heart, this case involves a clash between two basic intuitive principles,\" the judge said:\n\n\"If one party sends money to another by mistake, the latter should generally be required to give it back.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, if one party owes money to another and pays that money back to the penny, the latter should generally be allowed to keep and use the money as it wishes, without fear that the former will develop a case of borrower's remorse and claim that the payment was by mistake.\"\n\nWhere do you stand? The decision \u2014 which Citi will probably appeal \u2014 raises thorny questions about rules versus principles:\n\nSince it was a mistake by the bank, why not return the money?\n\nWhat responsibility do creditors have to the bank if it pays them back early?\n\nThis has generated a fascinating debate here at DealBook, and we'd like to hear what you think: Email us at dealbook@nytimes.com.

            "96": "Risk Takers: Citigroup's Jane Fraser is doing the unthinkable on Wall Street\n\nNew York CNN Business \u2014 Less than a month into her role as the chief executive of Citigroup, Jane Fraser made a decision that shook Wall Street.\n\nIt was late March, and signs of burnout were everywhere after more than a year of remote work in the pandemic. Deal volume was at record highs and showed no signs of letting up. Over at investment banking rival Goldman Sachs, young analysts made headlines with workplace horror stories that went beyond the typical long hours and cutthroat competition that Wall Street's known for. They were falling apart, mentally and emotionally.\n\nFraser saw an opportunity. And the memo she sent to Citi's 210,000 global staff would set the tone for how she would try to overhaul Citigroup \u2014 long languishing in third place and mired in bad press.\n\n\"The blurring of lines between home and work and the relentlessness of the pandemic workday have taken a toll on our well-being,\" she wrote. \"It's simply not sustainable.\"\n\nWhat followed was a reset plan that included the kinds of work-life balance measures you don't often see on Wall Street. Fraser implemented \"Zoom-free Fridays\" and urged staff to avoid scheduling calls outside traditional work hours. Take your vacations, she pleaded. Veteran bankers must have thought they were in the Twilight Zone.\n\nThen came the real shock: When Citi ultimately returns to the office, most roles will be designated as \"hybrid\" \u2014 with three days in office and up to two at home. Among American banks, that kind of flexibility was unheard of.\n\nIt was both a humane reaction to a mass trauma and a calculated strategic decision. By branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up and retaining talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the less-frenzied, or at least less formal, world of tech.\n\nFraser readily admits the decision wasn't purely about empathy \u2014 \"I want to crush the competition,\" she told Bloomberg News last month. But by not cracking the whip, she's also staking out a somewhat radical position on Wall Street: that ruthlessness doesn't have to define a bank's culture.\n\nBanking analysts and investors will be closely watching Fraser in March, when she plans to unveil Citigroup's cultural and structural rehabilitation plan for the next several years. It'll also mark her first full year as CEO \u2014 a timely check-in to see how her strategy is playing out.\n\nBy branding itself the \"bank with a soul,\" as Fraser calls it, Citi would have an edge in scooping up talent that might otherwise eschew Wall Street for the world of tech.\n\nNo one expects her to wave a magic wand and undo decades' worth of mismanagement overnight. But the March investor day will be a crucial early test. Shareholders are hungry for bold action. The biggest risk, says longtime banking analyst Mike Mayo, is not that the plan will be too aggressive \u2014 it's that it won't be aggressive enough.\n\nTurnaround job\n\nIt's hard to overstate what a difficult job Fraser, the first woman to lead a top American bank, has inherited.\n\nCitigroup's (C) stock is wildly underperforming. Its shares are up about 13% this year \u2014 dismal compared with the broader stock market, which has gained 24% in 2021. Citi's rivals are outpacing it by even more: Bank of America (BAC) is up 60%, and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is up 35%.\n\nIt's also under intense pressure from regulators, who for years have been cajoling the bank to overhaul its hodgepodge of internal risk-management and data systems.\n\nRegulators' concerns aren't unfounded. In August 2020, Citi committed one of the biggest blunders in the history of Wall Street when it erroneously wired nearly $1 billion of its own money to creditors of Revlon. The fat-finger error ultimately cost Citi more than $500 million when several of those creditors refused to return the funds.\n\nJust two months later, regulators slapped Citigroup with a $400 million fine for failing to address \"long-standing deficiencies.\"\n\nFraser's shakeup of office culture is a relatively easy win \u2014 necessary, perhaps, but far from sufficient, analysts say.\n\n\"Every day she gets a grade from shareholders, and that's the stock price,\" Mayo said in an interview with CNN Business. \"And every day that she's been in the role, the verdict is Citigroup is worth more dead than alive.\"\n\nIt's not enough to change the tone at the top, Mayo said. Fraser, who declined to comment for this article, has to address the sort governance lapses that have gotten the bank in trouble.\n\nIn a recent note to clients, Mayo and other analysts criticized Citi's decision to identify potential cash bonuses for top managers before their performance targets are even announced. \"That's like charging us for dinner before we know if we're getting hot dogs or caviar,\" the note said. \"Moreover, the awards are in cash vs. stock and seem like extra pay to execs for just doing their job.\"\n\nThat's terrible governance, Mayo says. \"And that's the terrible governance Citigroup has had for the last 10, 20, 50 or 100 years.\"\n\nBetter Call Jane\n\nThankfully for Citigroup, Fraser's no stranger to cleanup jobs.\n\nDuring the 2008 financial crisis, the bank very nearly collapsed because of its exposure to toxic mortgage-backed securities. As Citigroup hobbled along on life support in the form of a massive government bailout, Fraser \u2014 who joined the bank in 2004 \u2014ran its strategy division, overseeing sales of risky assets to streamline the bank's sprawling operations.\n\nShe later ran Citigroup's battered mortgage business and its Latin America operations, both decidedly thorny assignments in the fallout of the financial crisis.\n\nIn a 2018 interview with CNN, Fraser recalled people telling her she was \"crazy\" for taking over CitiMortgage just a few years after the housing market imploded. In hindsight, she said, it was the \"best decision I've ever made.\"\n\nThe lesson: You don't have to know everything.\n\n\"You learn from those situations... Because it was a crisis and because I didn't know anything,\" she said. \"You have to hire people that are better than you and more knowledgeable than you.\"\n\nFraser is widely credited for cleaning up Citi's Mexican subsidiary, which was emerging from a money-laundering scandal when she became CEO of Citigroup's Latin America operations in 2015. In that role, she also steered the bank through the devastation of Hurricane Maria. When the storm forced Citi's San Juan, Puerto Rico, branch to close, she oversaw efforts to bring in generators and other necessities to get the bank back up and running a week later.\n\n\"We don't leave a country when it's in really bad shape,\" Fraser told the New York Times in an interview in February. \"We can really make a difference.\"\n\nFraser, 54, comes to the role of CEO armed with a resume straight out of Wall Street central casting. She worked as a Goldman Sachs analyst after receiving her degree in economics at Cambridge. Then came the Harvard MBA, followed by a decade of work at consulting giant McKinsey before joining Citigroup in 2004.\n\nA 'glass cliff' moment?\n\nFraser regularly downplays the gender question in interviews. The fact that she's a woman running a major bank is historic, but it should hardly matter as long she does the job well. And that's true. But it's also impossible to ignore Corporate America's track record of sticking a woman in the driver's seat when the wheels are about to come off.\n\nResearch shows that women are more likely to be promoted to senior leadership positions when institutions are in trouble \u2014 a trend known as the glass cliff. Mary Barra, famously, made history as the first woman to run General Motors in 2014. But the automaker was a mess, still crawling out of bankruptcy and, two weeks into Barra's tenure, issuing a massive recall linked to 13 deaths that the company had known about for years.\n\nThere was a similar sense of crisis at Citi that accelerated Fraser's ascension.",

Let's get into it.\n\nFROZEN OVER\n\nUnthinkably cold temperatures have knocked Texas' energy facilities offline.\n\nElectricity prices spiked more than 10,000% when the winter storm hit this week. There are blackouts across the state. More than 4 million Texans were without power early Tuesday.\n\nPOINTING FINGERS\n\nAlthough some are attempting to pin the blame on one fuel source or another, the reality is that the Arctic temperatures are hobbling fossil fuels and renewable energy alike, my colleague Matt Egan explains.\n\nIt's striking that these power outages are happening in mighty Texas, the energy powerhouse of America. A bit of context:\n\nTexas produces more electricity than any other US state \u2014 generating almost twice as much as Florida, the next-closest, according to federal statistics.\n\nTexas is the No. 1 state in both crude oil and natural gas.\n\nWind power is also booming in Texas, which produced about 28% of all the US wind-powered electricity in 2019.\n\nWHAT HAPPENED?\n\nSo how did such a powerhouse get knocked so thoroughly offline?\n\nWe may not know the full definitive reason for a while, but a few things are clear:\n\nObviously, Texas winters ain't usually this cold. The state's infrastructure is simply not prepared for a deep freeze.\n\nCritics of renewables will try to blame wind turbines, but experts note that wind makes up a small share of Texas' energy consumption.\n\nIt's also worth poinitng out that a lot of chillier places have wind turbines that don't buckle in the cold \u2014 hello, Iowa; hej hej, Denmark \u2014 they just need to be winterized, a step experts said Texas has skipped.\n\nThe Lone Star State is ... all alone. Texas made a conscious decision to isolate its energy grid from the rest of the country. That means that when things are running smoothly, it can't export excess power to neighboring states. And in the current crisis, it can't import power either.\n\nIn other words: \"When it comes to electricity, what happens in Texas stays in Texas,\" said Dan Cohan, associate professor of environmental engineering at Rice University. \"That has really come back to bite us.\"\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nTo believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion \u2014 would have been borderline irrational.\n\n\u2014 US District Court Judge Jesse Furman\n\nCiti just lost a bid to fix a major oopsie. Last year, the bank fat-fingered $900 million to lenders for cosmetics company Revlon. Some lenders returned the erroneous funds, but others refused, prompting Citi to sue to recover half a billion dollars. On Tuesday, a federal judge said \u2014 and I'm paraphrasing here \u2014 lol no.\n\nTHE FOOD BUSINESS\n\nMcDonald's\n\nBIG CHICKEN\n\nAnother day, another escalation of the Chicken Sandwich Wars. At this point, you gotta do something special to make your sandwich stand out, so McDonald's is building buzz for its three new chickie sammies with a limited edition $5 swag bundle, which includes a hoodie, a vinyl recording of a custom song and, of course, a sandwich. (The star has got to be the hoodie, which comes in a hue that I can best describe as a \"light fried chicken color.\")\n\nBIG VEGAN\n\nNow for basically the opposite of chicken sandwiches: We have vegan KitKats now. Instead of dairy, KitKat V will use a rice-based alternative. Healthier? Nah. But more inclusive of people who eat plant-based diets? Yes!\n\nNUMBER OF THE DAY\n\n$50,000\n\nBitcoin hit an all-time high above $50,000 on Tuesday. That statement might have sounded like a joke a year ago, when the crypto cost $10,000. But bitcoin has skyrocketed during the pandemic thanks to rock-bottom interest rates that have severely weakened the US dollar. That makes bitcoin, a comparatively attractive currency.\n\nWHAT ELSE IS GOING ON\n\nMove over, Robinhood, here comes Goldman Sachs.

After that, the balance would be level \"at least\" until the end of 2023, before the \"roll-off\" of those bonds might begin. The roll-off means that bonds mature and roll off the balance sheet when they're redeemed and would not be replaced with new purchases.

A majority of her customers are members of the LGBTQ community and she is currently in litigation with the Colorado Attorney General to ensure that she and her business can carry on serving members of the community without fear of being shut down.Lorie Smith said she would do so if the Court rules for her in a lawsuit against the Attorney General's office, the Denver Post reported.In the case of 303 Creative v. Elenis, the issue is whether a wedding catering company has a right to refuse service to LGBTQ couples on the grounds that it is discriminating against them because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. If the court sides with the company, the plaintiff, Elenis, may be able to sue the caterer for refusing to serve her at the wedding. The plaintiff's attorneys argued that if the caterer took Elenis's order and she refused to serve her at the wedding, she would be discriminating against her. The company, on the other hand, argued that refusing to honor Elenis's request would be \"illegal discrimination\" on the grounds of sexual orientation, meaning that it could face lawsuits from gay couples who want their caterer to serve them, the Washington Blade reported. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in March and the final result is still in question. The Supreme Court is expected to hear the case in September, Lambda Legal's Jennifer Pizer said, adding that she was concerned about the potential for widespread discrimination if the court rules in favor of 303 Creative.",

John O'Donnell . Amazon has suspended Amazon Web Services (AWS) service from the far-right social network Parler. Parler has been using AWS to host the site since 2016. Amazon announced the suspension on its website today, which does not specifically state why it has suspended AWS service, but in a statement said that Parler had failed to comply with the terms of use of AWS, and would no longer be able to use AWS until the site complies with the terms. The suspended service is crucial for Parler, because Parler is currently unable to move its website to a different hosting service, as Amazon's decision could shut down the site without a new cloud provider, meaning all of Parler's users would lose their accounts. Parler's CEO, John Matze, responded to the news of Amazon's decision to ban Parler from its cloud services. He told CNBC that Amazon, Google, and Apple are colluding to eliminate competition.

Amazon and the rest of the tech giants are trying to suppress innovation and free speech. We will fight back. It is a victory for democracy, and a victory for the free-speech movement,' Matze said.

Amazon said that users of Parler will no longer be able to use Parler unless they delete the violent incitement posts the site currently carries, and Amazon has stated that it is willing to negotiate with Parler on a deal to remove the posts.

            "192": "Citing new evidence in court Friday, a lawsuit against Citibank accused lenders of \"willful negligence\" for not knowing they were receiving a payment that was supposed to go to a company called Revlon. The lawsuit was brought to court against four lenders that refused to return more than $900 million, citing New York's \"discharge-for-value\" exception. The case is the largest in the history of New York's bankruptcy courts. The Revlon case is the largest bankruptcy case in New York's history. It is thought that Citibank's error led to some of the largest firms in the world becoming insolvent. It has now been revealed in court documents that the lenders refused to return the unreturned funds despite Citibank arguing that the banks knew they were paying to a company called Revlon. Lenders claim Citibank failed to tell them the money was going to Revlon. In fact, they claim that Revlon never existed at all.",

The error occurred during a $894m (\u00c2\u00a3668m) Revlon loan, which Citibank said a mistake in a simple user interface meant the transaction was processed as if it were interest payments. The 'three-eyed policy' meant a Wipro employee had to be in control of the transaction and a local manager in India needed to approve it, but a mistake was made by Wipro staff who did the actual transaction to pay the $894m principal to Revlon's 315 creditors earlier than its due date in 2023, Citibank said in a statement. Citibank said it had taken steps to avoid similar mistakes in the future, such as a six-eyes policy; a local manager and staff in India need to approve loans with a foreign parent. Wipro, which provides IT services to Citibank and many of its customers, is an Indian company with over two million employees. A Citibank spokeswoman said: \"We have apologised to our customers, the public and Wipro for this mistake and have taken steps to ensure that similar mistakes do not occur in the future.\" The Citibank spokesperson did not respond to requests to comment further on the three-eyed policy, which was used to justify the error.",
